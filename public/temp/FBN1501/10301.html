<p><span class="BodyText">The graph of the cumulative frequency distribution is better known as the cumulative frequency curve or Ogive. &nbsp;The word Ogive is basically a term used in architecture to describe curves or curved shapes.</span></p>

		<p class="Definition">An Ogive is a graph that represents the cumulative frequencies of the intervals in a&nbsp;frequency distribution. &nbsp;It shows the data below or above a particular value.</p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Ogive is pronounced as &quot;O-jive&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Ogive is a graph of a cumulative distribution, which shows data values on the horizontal axis and the&nbsp;cumulative frequencies on the vertical axis. &nbsp;The Ogive is constructed by plotting a point corresponding to the cumulative frequency of each interval.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The Ogive for Radial is given below. &nbsp;Previously we calculated that <span class="math-tex">\(22\Ndp5 \%\)</span>&nbsp;of Radial&#39;s customers drove&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(46\Tsp000\)</span>&nbsp;kilometres or less with a set of tyres. &nbsp;Such information can be presented graphically once the cumulative frequencies are known.</span></p>
