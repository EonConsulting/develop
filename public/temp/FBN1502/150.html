<h3 class="Heading2">Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Ren&eacute; Descartes was a French man who lived in the 1600s. &nbsp;He invented the&nbsp;rectangular coordinate system or plane. &nbsp;In fact, this coordinate system is sometimes called the Cartesian plane&nbsp;in his honour. &nbsp;Using this plane, we can describe any&nbsp;point in the plane using an ordered pair of numbers.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The Cartesian plane is like a map grid. &nbsp;You can locate any point in the Cartesian plane if you know two things:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">how far the point is to the </span>left or right<span class="Bullet_List_2">, and</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">how far the point is </span>up or down<span class="Bullet_List_2">.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="BodyText">Let us start by looking at a map, given below. &nbsp;In this city map, the Town Hall is right at the centre of the town. &nbsp;As you travel east of the centre of town, the streets are named <span class="PalAa">10th&nbsp;Street East</span>, <span class="PalAa">11th Street East</span> and so forth. &nbsp;You find similar patterns as you drive west, north or south. &nbsp;<span class="PalAa">Middle Street</span> is really zero east and zero west simultaneously, so it is easiest to just give it a name. &nbsp;Similarly, <span class="PalAb">Main Road</span> is simultaneously zero north and zero south.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">You can easily find any location on the map just by knowing how far it is east or west and north or south of the centre of town. The car is at about the crossing of <span class="PalAa">11th Street East</span> and <span class="PalAb">11th Street North</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For the Cartesian plane we use positive and negative numbers. &nbsp;If <span class="PalAa">Middle Street</span> is at zero east and west,&nbsp;and <span class="PalAb">Main Road</span> is at&nbsp;zero north and south, then east and north will be&nbsp;positive while west and south will be&nbsp;negative.</span></p>
