<h3 class="Heading2">Fixed or variable?</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A loan can have a fixed interest rate or a variable interest rate.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="Heading3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="PalAa">Variable interest rate</span></h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A <span class="PalAa">variable interest rate</span> loan is a loan in which the interest rate charged on the outstanding balance varies as&nbsp;market interest rates <span class="PalAa">change</span>. &nbsp;As a result, your payments will vary as well, if&nbsp;your payments&nbsp;consist of&nbsp;a blend of&nbsp;principal and interest payments.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="PalAa">Fixed interest rate</span></h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Fixed interest rate loans are loans in which the <span class="PalAa">interest rate</span> charged on the loan will <span class="PalAa">remain fixed</span> for that&nbsp;loan&#39;s entire term, no matter what market interest rates do. &nbsp;This will result in your payments being the&nbsp;same over the entire term. &nbsp;If interest rates fall, you do not stand to benefit as your rates remain fixed.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Whether a fixed-rate loan is better for you will depend on the interest rate environment when the loan is&nbsp;taken out and on the duration of the loan.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3" style="text-align: center;"><span class="PalAa">Interest rates: Fixed or variable?</span></h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">When a loan is fixed for its entire term, it will be fixed at the prevailing market <span class="PalAa">interest rate</span> at the time the loan is taken out. &nbsp;Generally&nbsp;speaking, if interest rates are relatively low, but are about to increase, then it will be better to lock&nbsp;in your loan at that fixed rate. &nbsp;Depending on the terms of your agreement, your interest rate on the new&nbsp;loan will remain fixed, even if <span class="PalAa">interest rates</span> climb to higher levels. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">On the other hand, if interest rates&nbsp;are on the decline, then it would be better to have a variable rate loan. As interest rates fall, so will the&nbsp;interest rate on your loan.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">This discussion is simplistic, but the explanation will not change in a more complicated situation. &nbsp;It is&nbsp;important to note that studies have found that over time, the borrower is likely to pay less interest overall&nbsp;with a variable rate loan versus a fixed rate loan. &nbsp;However, the borrower must consider the&nbsp;<span class="PalAa">amortisation </span>period of a loan. &nbsp;The longer the <span class="PalAa">amortisation </span>period of a loan, the greater the impact a&nbsp;change in interest rates will have on your payments.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Therefore, <span class="PalAa">variable interest rate loans</span> are beneficial for a borrower in a decreasing interest rate environment,&nbsp;but when interest rates rise, loan payments will rise sharply.</span></p>
