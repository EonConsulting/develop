<h3 class="Heading2">Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText"><span class="BodyText">Cost</span>, <span class="BodyText">revenue</span> and <span class="BodyText">profit</span> are the three most important factors in determining the success of a company. &nbsp;A company can have high revenue, but if the costs are higher, it will show no profit and is destined to go out of business when available capital runs out. &nbsp;Managing costs and revenue to maximize profit is the key for any company.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The <span class="PalAa">total cost</span> faced by companies can be divided&nbsp;into two main categories: <span class="PalBc">fixed costs</span> and <span class="PalAb">variable costs</span>.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">

<h3 class="Heading3"><span class="PalBc">Fixed cost</span></h3>

<p>Fixed costs are costs that are independent of output. &nbsp;These remain constant throughout&nbsp;production. It is the upfront cost a business must pay to create an infrastructure.</p>

<p>Examples of fixed costs are rent,&nbsp;buildings and&nbsp;equipment.</p>

<p>The best way to identify fixed cost is to produce zero output. &nbsp;</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">

	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition"><span class="BodyText"><span class="PalBc">Fixed cost</span> is incurred whether or not any output is produced.</span></p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 class="Heading3"><span class="PalAb">Variable cost</span></h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Variable costs may fluctuate during production. &nbsp;During production these costs may change.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Examples of variable costs are labour directly involved in production,&nbsp;raw materials,&nbsp;fuel expenses and&nbsp;packaging.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Variable cost can be calculated using the formula:</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition"><span class="PalAb">variable cost</span>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(=\)</span> number of units produced <span class="math-tex">\(\times\)</span><br />
		variable cost&nbsp;to produce a single unit</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
