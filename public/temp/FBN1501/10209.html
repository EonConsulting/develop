<h3 class="Heading2">Dis-&nbsp;and -advantages</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A political candidate wishes to determine the opinions of the voters in his ward. &nbsp;He has a list of voters available. &nbsp;He could, for example, start with voter number&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(6\)</span>&nbsp;and thereafter choose each tenth voter to complete a questionnaire.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Disadvantage of systematic sampling</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">What is the disadvantage of such a method? &nbsp;If the variable being considered is periodic in nature, systematic sampling may lead to misleading results.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The disadvantage is that the system may interact with some hidden pattern in the population, for example every third house along a&nbsp;street might always be the middle one of a terrace of three. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Or if, for example, we are to estimate a shop&#39;s sales and use a&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(1\)</span>-in-<span class="math-tex">\(7\)</span> systematic sampling design, it could happen that only sales figures for Saturdays are chosen.<br />
Sales will then be overestimated.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Advantage of systematic sampling</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The advantage of systematic sampling is that the sample is spread evenly over the population. &nbsp;It is convenient, especially when the size of the population is not known.<br />
It is also easier to conduct than a random sample.</span></p>
