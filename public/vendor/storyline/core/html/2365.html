        <h2>Measurement of price elasticity</h2>
        <h3>What will we measure?</h3>
        <p>
            Earlier on, we described price elasticity as a measure of how sensitive or responsive the quantity
            demanded of a good or service is to a change in the price of the good or service.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the topic on demand, supply and prices, we investigated how prices are determined by the
            interaction between demand and supply, and how changes in demand and supply lead to
            changes in prices. In our explanation, we generalised things by saying, for instance, that an
            increase in the cost of production will reduce the supply, and the equilibrium price will thus
            increase, and the equilibrium quantity demanded and supplied will decrease.
        </p>
        <p>
            We illustrated this by making use of demand and supply diagrams. We indicated that an
            increase in the cost of production shifts the supply curve upwards, causing an increase in the
            price, and that a consequence of this increase in price is that the quantity demanded
            decreases. It is this impact of a change in price on the quantity demanded that we are trying to
            measure.
        </p>
        <p>
            What this demand and supply analysis did not tell is by how much the quantity demanded will
            change if the price changes. Will households react to an increase in the price of a good or
            service by decreasing their quantity demanded by a large amount or a small amount?
        </p>
        <p>
            And how will this increase in price change households’ spending and the total revenue of firms?
            We will answer these questions by calculating the price elasticity coefficient, which gives us a
            measure of how sensitive or responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price.

            How will we measure it?
        </h3>
        <p class="self-assessment-intro" style="margin-bottom:0;">
            Let’s start with a question:
        </p>
        <!--embedded activity-->
        <div class="activity-asset">
            <iframe src="2350.html" frameborder="0" id="asset2350" height="470"></iframe>

        <!--end of-->
        <p style="margin-top:-36px;">
            Let’s see what happens when we know what the percentage changes are.
        </p>
        <p class="self-assessment-intro">In each of the questions below, select the best answer.</p>
        
        <!--embedded activity-->
        <div class="activity-asset">
            <iframe src="2351.html" frameborder="0" id="asset2351" height="490"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <!--end of-->
        <p style="margin-top:-36px;">
            Once we know these percentages changes, it is possible to measure price elasticity through the
            price elasticity coefficient.
        </p>
        <h3>The price elasticity coefficient</h3>
        <p>
            If we know what the percentage change in price and the percentage change in quantity
            demanded are, we can calculate the price elasticity coefficient by using the following formula:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s8 offset-s2">
                <img src="../assets/47.svg"> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Using symbols, this is written as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s8 offset-s2">
                <img style="margin-left: 199px;" src="48.png" class="centered-graph"> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Using the data in our example, where the price increases by 100% and the quantity demanded
            decreases by 1%, the price elasticity coefficient for the good is:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s8 offset-s2">
                <img style="margin-left: 199px;" src="49.png" class="centered-graph"> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Should the answer not be –0,01? It should indeed. Since the quantity demanded decreases, it
            should be reflected as –1%, and the answer should therefore be –0,01. Economists usually ignore
            the negative sign, and report the elasticity coefficient as a positive value (in mathematics, this is
            called absolute values). One of the reasons for this is that we know that the law of demand
            indicates a negative relationship between the price and quantity demanded and,
            consequently, the value of the price elasticity coefficient will always be negative. Nothing is lost
            by using the absolute values as long as we remember that we are dealing with an inverse
            relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus far it all seems to be straightforward. Obtain the percentage changes, and then calculate
            the price elasticity using the formula. And it is indeed that simple, except that we need to deal
            with how the percentage changes are to be calculated.

                The price elasticity coefficient gives us a measure of how sensitive or responsive the quantity
                demanded of a good or service is to a change in the price of the good or service. It is our
                measure of price elasticity.

            If you do the same exercise, but assume that the price decreases from R10 to R8, will you obtain
            the same price elasticity coefficient as in the previous example that used an increase in the
            price from R8 to R10?
        </p>
        <p class="self-assessment-intro">Do the calculation and see what the answer would be:</p>

        <p>
            The reason for this difference is that it depends on the starting point (the value we use as the
            basis for our calculations). It the starting value for price is R8, a R2 increase in price implies a 25%
            increase in the price. If the starting value for price is R10, a R2 decrease in price implies a 20%
            decrease in price. The same happens for the change in quantity demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we are looking for is a measure that is independent of the starting point or direction of
            change. A R2 increase in the price should give us the same answer as a R2 decrease in price.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve this problem, we make use of the midpoint method to calculate the price elasticity
            coefficient.

            <i>
                When price elasticity is calculated using two points, it is known as <strong>arch elasticity</strong>. The midpoint
                method involves using the average of the initial and ending values.

        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s use our previous example, where:

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>10</td>

            Assuming that the price decreases from R10 to R8 will give the same result. We have eliminated
            the ‘increase versus decrease’ issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we add all the above steps together, we end up with the following formula for calculating
            arch elasticity:

        <p>
            This looks rather intimidating, but it is nothing more than a combination of the various steps. The
            (Q<sub>2</sub> – Q<sub>1</sub> ) is the difference between the end value and the initial value of the quantity
            demanded (90 – 100). <br/>The [(Q<sub>1</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub> )/2] is the midpoint value for the quantity demanded [(100 +
            90)/2]. The (P<sub>2</sub> – P<sub>1</sub> ) is the difference between the end value and initial value for the price (R10 –
            R8).<br/> The [(P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> )/2] is the midpoint value for the price [(R8 + R10)/2]. We have left out the
            multiplication by 100 since it occurs above and below the line, which means that each cancels
            out the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            The (Q<sub>2</sub> – Q<sub>1</sub> )/ [(Q<sub>1</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub> )/2] gives us the percentage change in quantity demanded (10,5%)<br/>
            while (P<sub>2</sub> – P<sub>1</sub> )/[(P<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> )/2] gives us the percentage change in price (22,2%).
        </p>
        <p>
            We can even further simplify the formula by getting rid of the 2 since it occurs above and below
            the line, and end up with the following formula for arch elasticity using the midpoint method:

        <div class="row">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Using the data in our example, the arch elasticity can be calculated as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s8 offset-s2">

        <p>
            This price elasticity coefficient of 0,47 is the ratio between the percentage change in price and
            the percentage change in quantity demanded, and tells us that a 1% increase in price will
            cause a 0.47% decrease in quantity demanded, and that a 1% decrease in price will cause a
            0,47% increase in quantity demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we conclude the measurement of price elasticity, let’s calculate price elasticity based on
            another example.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following diagram shows what happens if the supply of say, restaurant meals, decreases
            because of an increase in the cost of producing restaurant meals. The equilibrium price
            increases and the equilibrium quantity declines. What you need to do is to calculate the price
            elasticity coefficient for restaurant meals for the price increase range R100 to R110.
        </p>
        <div class="row">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            The data in the diagram is reproduced in the following table:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>P</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Qd</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>R100</td>
                    <td>1000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>R110</td>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <br />
        <p>
            In the above diagram, we see that as the price increases from R100 to R110, the quantity
            demanded decreases from 1 000 to 750. We now have sufficient data to calculate the price
            elasticity coefficient for restaurant meals for the price range R100 to R110. We do this by
            applying the formula for price elasticity.

            What this means is that for every 1% increase in the price, the quantity demanded will decrease
            by 3%, and for every 1% decrease in price, the quantity demanded will increase by 3%.
