<h1> A complete circular flow</h1>

        <p>Now that we have identified two main participants in the economy, namely households and firms, and two markets, namely the factor
 and goods markets, we can design a model to show the interactions between firms and households through the goods and factor markets. </p>

<h5>Between firms and households </h5> 
       <div class="activity-asset">

    </div>

<h5>Complete circular flow </h5>
<p>We can now use this model to explain what happens to the flows if, for instance, spending by households increases. </p>

<ul>
<li>As spending by households increases, the monetary flow from households to firms increases through the goods market. </li>
<li>As the goods move from firms to households, the real flow from firms to households increases.</li> 
<li>This increased spending by households causes firms to increase production since the demand for goods is higher.As firms increase production, the production flow increases and more factors of production are employed. </li>
<li>There is thus an increase in the income flow from firms to households through the factor market.</li>  </p>
</ul>
