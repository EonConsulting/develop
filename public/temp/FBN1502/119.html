<h3 class="Heading2">A formula for calculating <span class="math-tex">\(S\)</span></h3>

<p><span class="PalAb">Compound interest</span> yields&nbsp;better results than <span class="PalAa">simple interest</span>, so you make more money. &nbsp;Compound interest is just the repeated application of simple interest to an amount which is at each stage increased by the simple interest earned in the previous period. &nbsp;But as the investment term stretches over a long period, we will have to do a lot of calculations. &nbsp;So,&nbsp;let us consider a&nbsp;formula for the general situation.</p>

<h3 class="Heading3">The formula for the general situation</h3>

<p>Suppose you deposit a principal amount&nbsp;ô€€ƒ<span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>, at a certain annual interest rate&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span>, but&nbsp;compounded after every time period of some specified length. How&nbsp;much is your accumulated sum <span class="math-tex">\(S\)</span> after <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> time periods?</p>

<p>We let <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> denote the percentage interest your money earns each time period.<br />
Then after each time period your money is multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\((1+i)\)</span> where <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> is expressed as a decimal. &nbsp;After <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> compoundings, your money has been multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\((1+i)\)</span> a total of <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> times. &nbsp;Your accumulated sum <span class="math-tex">\(S\)</span>&nbsp;is given by the formula:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(S=P(1+i)^n\)</span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Skeleton" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 10%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">where</td>
		<td style="width: 10%; vertical-align: top;"><span class="math-tex">\(S\)</span></td>
		<td style="text-align: left;">is the accumulated sum/accrued principal/future value&nbsp;(total money at end of period)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 10%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;</td>
		<td style="width: 10%; vertical-align: top;"><span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span></td>
		<td style="text-align: left;">is the principal or present value (original amount invested or borrowed)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="width: 10%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;</td>
		<td style="width: 10%; vertical-align: top;"><span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span></td>
		<td style="text-align: left;">is the rate of interest <span class="math-tex">\((\%)\)</span>&nbsp;per period, given as a decimal fraction</td>
	</tr>

		<td style="width: 10%; text-align: right; vertical-align: top;">&nbsp;</td>
		<td style="width: 10%; vertical-align: top;"><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span></td>

<p>There are four variables needed when determining compound interest. &nbsp;If you know any three of these, the fourth can be determined.</p>

<p>The formula is not difficult to remember if you understand how it is derived. &nbsp;At each compounding the amount is multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\((1+i)\)</span>, so that after <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> compoundings the original principal <span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span> has been multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\((1+i)^n\)</span>.</p>
