<p>From households to firms, there is a flow of factors of production through the factor market, as illustrated by the <a graph="graph1" src="cf13.svg">green dotted line</a>. 
This is a real flow. An example of this flow would be you leaving your house in the morning to go to work at a 
firm. This is an example of a real flow of labour. Then there is also the flow of capital, land and entrepreneurs from households to firms. 
This real flow of the factors of production takes place through the factor market. </p>

<p>From firms to households, there is an income flow through the factor market as firms pay households for the use of the factors of production 
owned by households, as indicated by the <a graph="graph1" src="cf14.svg">orange solid line</a>. This is a monetary flow. An example of this flow would be you 
receiving payment in the form of a wage by the firm you are working for. Rent for land, interest for capital and profits for entrepreneurs 
are all monetary flows and part of the income flow. </p>
