<h3 class="Heading2">Farmer example</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A peanut farmer&rsquo;s <span class="PalAa">cost function</span> in rand, is given by</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa C(\PalAb x)=\displaystyle\frac{\PalAb x^2}{100}+100\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">where <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb x\)</span> represents the <span class="PalAb">number</span> <span class="PalAb">of kilograms </span>of peanuts produced.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The graph of the <span class="PalAa">total cost function</span> is given below:</span></p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="650" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/264.html" width="650"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We can clearly see that the cost function is continuously increasing until it reaches a point where it will be extremely expensive for him to produce another kilogram of peanuts. &nbsp;The <span class="PalBb">slope</span> of the function is not constant and there is no constant rate of change. &nbsp;Thus the <span class="PalBb">slope</span> changes continuously.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The farmer can see how the cost is increasing, but he cannot see how a change in production level will influence the cost. &nbsp;In other words, if he produces at a certain production level, what will it cost to produce one extra kilogram?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For instance, if the farmer produces <span class="math-tex">\(1\Tsp000\)</span> kilograms of peanuts and he is interested in knowing how the cost will change if one extra kilogram is produced, then he wants to determine the <span class="PalBb">marginal cost</span> at a production level of <span class="math-tex">\(1\Tsp000\)</span> kilograms.</span></p>
