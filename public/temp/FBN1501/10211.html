<h3 class="Heading2">Presentation</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Consider the tyre company&nbsp;Radial again.&nbsp; It took a sample of <span class="math-tex">\(80\)</span>&nbsp;out of the population of <span class="math-tex">\(2\:600\)</span>&nbsp;sets of tyres that were sold during the previous six months.<br />
Radial is happy that its sample is representative. &nbsp;The variable in this sample is the number of thousands of kilometres that a customer had driven until one of the four tyres no longer met the minimum safety requirements. &nbsp;In short, the variable is the number of kilometres driven. &nbsp;The sample is given below.</span></p>
