<h3 class="Heading2">Practical applications of quadratic functions</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A parabola is the curve that is produced by graphing a quadratic or second-degree equation. &nbsp;Parabolas have many practical applications.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Parabolas occur frequently in the real world. &nbsp;Consider the following examples of parabolas we can find all around us.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Suspension bridge</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The parabola can be seen most&nbsp;visibly when looking up at a suspension bridge. &nbsp;The trace formed by the cables as they suspend from the highest point to the lowest is in the shape of a parabola.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Projectile motion</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">During a basketball game, the shots taken by the players trace out a parabola in the air. &nbsp;In fact, this is probably one of the most common applications of the parabola, namely the projectile motion.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Satellite dish</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">In addition to the applications mentioned above, parabolic surfaces have technological applications. For example, satellite dishes are in the shape of parabolic surfaces.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Reflector</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Another technological application of the parabolic surface can be found in reflectors. &nbsp;The headlamps of your car, for example, are in this shape. &nbsp;<br />
When you are driving on a&nbsp;dark&nbsp;road and have your brights on, it is the parabolic surface of your headlamp reflectors that enable you to see further ahead. &nbsp;The bulb is placed at a special point called the focus of the parabola. &nbsp;The light is shone from the focus and the curved surface shoots the light out of the bottom of the parabola.</span></p>
