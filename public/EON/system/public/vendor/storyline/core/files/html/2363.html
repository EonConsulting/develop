        <h2>Overview of price elasticity</h2>
        <p>
            We are still on our exciting journey investigating how a society can deal with the economic
            problem of scarce resources and unlimited needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This scarcity problem forces us to make choices, and every choice we make has a cost – the
            opportunity cost – which is the best alternative we give up by making this choice. We have
            seen that because of this scarcity problem, every society needs to answer the following
            three fundamental questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What should be produced?</li>
            <li>How should it be produced?</li>
            <li>For whom should it be produced?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We have identified the market system as a possible way to deal with these questions, and
            indicated that in a market system it is the price mechanism that helps society to deal with
            these fundamental questions. To explain how the price mechanism operates, we have
            developed a model – the demand and supply model.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this model, we have shown how the price of a good or service is determined by the
            interaction between the forces of demand and supply. We have explained demand with
            the aid of a demand curve and supply with the aid of a supply curve, and indicated how
            the equilibrium price and quantity are formed in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this model, we have shown that prices have a signalling and rationing function in that
            they rise and fall to indicate excess demand (shortage) and excess supply (surplus), and how
            through price changes, this excess demand or excess supply is eliminated.
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, if households have a higher demand for goods and services, the demand for
            these goods and services increases. An excess demand is thus created, which causes the
            price to rise and the quantity demanded and supplied to adjust. A signal has thus been sent
            from the households to the producers.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if there is an increase in the supply of a good or service, the supply from producers
            increases. An excess supply is thus created, which causes the price to fall and the quantity
            demanded and supplied to adjust. A signal has therefore been sent from producers to
            households.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this topic, we will now take a closer look at the demand for a good or service by
            investigating the relationship between a change in price and the change in quantity
            demanded. This will give us a better understanding of how households and firms are
            influenced by a change in the price of a good or service.
        </p>

            What do we do when prices increase?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The way we react to an increase in price depends largely on the kind of product whose
            price increases.

            Can you see how people in different countries react to increases in prices?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following activities, you need to indicate how you would feel about an increase in the
            price of petrol compared to an increase in the price of ice cream.

            To get a better understanding of how households and firms react, and how they are influenced
            by price changes, we need to unpack the concept of ‘price elasticity’, which is what we will
            start doing in the next section.
