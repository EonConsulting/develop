<p><span class="BodyText">Profit is a very important concept for any business. &nbsp;Profit earned by a business can be used to measure the success of the business. &nbsp;Profit is also an important signal to other providers of finance to a business. &nbsp;Banks, suppliers and other lenders are more likely to provide finance to a business that can demonstrate it makes a profit and can pay debts as they fall due.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Profits earned which are kept in the business are an important source of finance for the business. &nbsp;The moment a product is sold for more than it cost to produce, then a profit is earned which can be reinvested.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Profit can be measured and calculated. &nbsp;So here is the formula:</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition"><span class="BodyText">profit&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(=\)</span>&nbsp;total revenue&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(-\)</span>&nbsp;total costs</span></p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">Profit maximization is the process by which a firm determines the price and output level that returns the greatest profit.</span></p>
