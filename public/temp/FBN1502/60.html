<h3 class="Heading2">Special case of straight line parallel to <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-axis: Examples</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">When a line with undefined slope is drawn, it will look vertical, just like a steep cliff. &nbsp;The sketch below shows three vertical lines, all with undefined (infinite) slope.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Notice that all the lines have similar equations in that they all look like <span class="math-tex">\(x=\text{some value}\)</span>. &nbsp;Just like a vertical cliff face, a vertical line does not progress, or change,&nbsp;in the horizontal, or <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>, direction. &nbsp;Every point on the line has the same <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>&nbsp;value.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Note the vertical line in the sketch above. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of every point on the&nbsp;vertical line is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>. &nbsp;The&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-coordinate can have any value.</span></p>
