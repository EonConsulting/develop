<h3 class="Heading2">GDP omits</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">By now we know that the gross domestic product or GDP measures the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in one year.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Economists believe that the GDP is not the best measure for a country&#39;s progress of well-being. &nbsp;The following internet&nbsp;site lists a few reasons why they feel the GDP must be replaced by a better measure:<br />
<u>http://staffwww.fullcoll.edu/fchan/macro/2gdp_definition.htm</u></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Intermediate goods (goods that are inputs in the production of other goods) are not included in GDP to avoid double counting. &nbsp;In another words, only the value added is counted.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">GDP only counts the value of final products produced within a geographical boundary of a country. &nbsp;If South African citizens are working in Europe, they do not contribute to the South African GDP, but Europe&#39;s GDP.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">GDP sums the rand value of what has been produced in the economy over the year, not what was actually sold. &nbsp;For example, used car sales are not included.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">GDP was not designed to be a measure of well being of the society. &nbsp;GDP omits the following:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Non-marketable goods and services: tasks that do not involve market transactions, such as baby sitting, house cleaning, lawn mowing and so forth.<br />
Some very useful output is excluded because it is unpaid employment.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Underground activities: illegal or cash transactions have no record.<br />
Government&#39;s estimates on these transactions are not accurate.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Sales of used items: GDP measures only current output. &nbsp;Used car and thrift stores&#39; transactions are not counted.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Financial transactions: trading existing assets, such as stock or bond purchases.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Transfer payments: either government or private transfer payments are not included because goods and services are not produced in this process. &nbsp;Examples are social security benefits or kid&#39;s allowances.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Leisure: individuals consume leisure, just as they consume all the other tangible goods, which generate satisfactions. &nbsp;But leisure has no price tag, so it is not included in GDP.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Social costs: production processes may cause pollution. &nbsp;Polluted air and water may have social costs like bad air quality, and cancer patients. &nbsp;These social costs reduce our economic well-being. &nbsp;If money is not spent to clean up the oil spill or to cure the cancer patients, those expenses are not added to the GDP.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">GDP does not measure quality or nature of the product, which contributes to the satisfaction level of the consumers. &nbsp;Nominal GDP simply adds the dollar value of the product; it makes no&nbsp;differences if the product is a weapon, or a book.&nbsp;</span></li>
