<li>If the inequality symbol is <span class="PalAb">greater than</span> <span class="math-tex">\((&gt;)\)</span> or <span class="PalAb">less than</span> <span class="math-tex">\((&lt;)\)</span>, then you will use a <span class="PalAb">dashed</span> boundary&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">line. &nbsp;This means that the solutions are <span class="PalAb">not</span> included on the boundary line.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">If the inequality symbol is <span class="PalAa">greater than or equal to</span> <span class="math-tex">\((\geq)\)</span> or <span class="PalAa">less than or equal to</span> <span class="math-tex">\((\leq)\)</span>, then you will&nbsp;use a <span class="PalAa">solid line</span> to indicate that the solutions are included on the boundary line.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the solution space for the system continues forever in at least one direction, it is called an&nbsp;<span class="BodyTex">unbounded solution</span>.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the solution space for the system has lines on all sides, it is called a <span class="BodyTex">closed</span> or <span class="BodyTex">bounded solution</span>.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li>If the solution spaces for the individual lines do not overlap, the system has <span class="BodyTex">no solution</span>.</li>
