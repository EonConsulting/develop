#CSV

Laravel 5 package to read and write CSV files.

##Instalation

First run composer command

<code>composer require csv</code>

Next add service provider to <code>config/app.php</code> file

    'providers' => [
        //... 
        Wilgucki\Csv\CsvServiceProvider::class,
    ]

Add facades to <code>config/app.php</code> file

    'aliases' => [
        //...
        'CsvReader' => Wilgucki\Csv\Facades\Reader::class,
        'CsvWriter' => Wilgucki\Csv\Facades\Writer::class,
    ]

Last step is to publish package config

<code>php artisan vendor:publish --provider="\Csv\CsvServiceProvider"</code>

##Usage

###Config file

Package config can be found in csv.php file under config directory (after you published it).
Config file contains default values for delimiter, enclosure and escape parameters. You can set default values here and skip passing
additional parameters to open and create methods (we discuss them later).

####Convert encoding

Common issue when working with CSV files generated by Excel is encoding. Excel exports CSV file encoded with windows-1250 character set
while most of PHP applications use UTF-8. To solve this issue, you can set encoding option in config file. You set your encoding
preferences separately for reader and writer.

    'encoding' => [
        'reader' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'from' => 'CP1250',
            'to' => 'UTF-8'
        ],
        'writer' => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'from' => 'UTF-8',
            'to' => 'CP1250'
        ]
    ]

As you can see in the example above, Reader will convert windows-1250 encoding to UTF-8, while Writer will do this in opposite way.
You don't have to use both options. You can set encoding conversion only for one class - reader or writer.

###Reader

First you need to open CSV file.

    $reader = CsvReader::open('/path/to/file.csv');

If you need to change delimiter, enclosure or escape you can do it by passing proper values to <code>open</code> method.
More information about these values can be found here - [http://php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fgetcsv.php).

    $reader = CsvReader::open('/path/to/file.csv', ';', '\'', '\\\\');

Having your CSV file opened you can read it line after line

    while (($line = $reader->readLine()) !== false) {
        print_r($line);
    }

or you could read whole file at once

    print_r($reader->readAll());

If your CSV file contains header line, you can convert it into array keys for each line.

    $reader = CsvReader::open($file, ';');
    $header = $reader->getHeader();
    print_r($header);
    print_r($reader->readAll());

Don't forget to close file after you're done with your work.

    $reader->close();

##Writer

At first you need to create new file
    
    $writer = CsvWriter::create('/path/where/your/file/will/be/saved.csv');

File path is optional. If you won't provide it, CsvWriter will use memory as storege for added content.

If you need to change delimiter, enclosure or escape you can do it by passing proper values to <code>create</code> method.
More information about these values can be found here - [http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php).

    $writer = CsvWriter::create('/path/to/file.csv', ';', '\'', '\\\\');

To add data into CSV file you can use <code>writeLine</code> or <code>writeAll</code> methods.

    $writer->writeLine(['some', 'data']);
    $writer->writeLine(['another', 'line']);
    
    $writer->writeAll([
        ['some', 'data'],
        ['another', 'line'],
    ]);

To display data added to CSV file, you can use flush method.

    echo $writer->flush();

Don't forget to close file after you're done with your work.

    $writer->close();

##Integrating with Eloquent models

If you want/need to integrate CsvReader and/or CsvWriter with Eloquent model, there's a simple way to do this.
The Csv package offers three traits in order to simplify the process. You can use all traits as well as one or two of your choise.

**These traits hasn't been tested for relations.**

###CsvCustomCollection

CsvCustomCollection trait added to model class enables <code>toCsv</code> method that can be used on collection.

    use Wilgucki\Csv\Traits\CsvCustomCollection;
    
    class SomeModel extends Model
    {
        use CsvCustomCollection;
        
        //...
    }
    
    $items = SomeModel::all(); // you can use where as well
    $csvData = $items->toCsv();

###CsvExportable

CsvExportable trait allows you to convert single model object to CSV data.

    use Wilgucki\Csv\Traits\CsvExportable;
    
    class SomeModel extends Model
    {
        use CsvExportable;
        
        //...
    }
    
    $csvData = SomeModel::find(1)->toCsv();

###CsvImportable

CsvImportable trait allows you to import data from CSV file and save it to database.
Imported file must have header line containing column names as they are named in database table. Primary key must be named **id**.
CSV importer will update all rows with matching id and add every row that isn't found in table.

Each column from CSV file is checked against <code>$fillable</code> array, letting to insert or update only these columns that are
present in it.

    use Wilgucki\Csv\Traits\CsvImportable;
    
    class SomeModel extends Model
    {
        use CsvImportable;
        
        //...
    }
    
    SomeModel::fromCsv('/path/to/file.csv');

##Command line

###csv:import

To import CSV file into database table, use csv:import command.

<code>php artisan csv:import model csv-file</code>

- model - model class name with its namespace
- csv-file - file name with path relative to project's root directory

If you would like to import users, you could use command like this (remember to use correct CSV file path)

<code>php artisan csv:import "App\User" storage/users.csv</code>

###csv:export

This command allows you to export data from database table into CSV file.

<code>php artisan csv:export model csv-file</code>

- model - model's class name with its namespace
- csv-file - file name with path relative to project's root directory

If you would like to export users, you could use command like this (remember to use correct CSV file path)

<code>php artisan csv:export "App\User" storage/users.csv</code>

##TODO

- import/export to CSV with relations
