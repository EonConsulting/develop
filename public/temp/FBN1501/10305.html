<h3 class="Heading2">Normal curve</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The standard deviation was defined as the square root of the variance. &nbsp;But what does it tell us? &nbsp;It tells us how far away the observations are from the mean. The larger the standard deviation, the further away are the data points from the mean.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The following schematic presentation shows how many of the data points are between the standard deviation to the left and to the right of the mean.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For data sets that have a normal distribution the standard deviation&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((\text{SD})\)</span> can be used to determine the proportion of values that lie within a particular range of the mean value.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For such <span class="Emphasis_1">normal distributions</span> it is always the case that:</span></p>
