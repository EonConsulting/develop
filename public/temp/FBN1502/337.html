<h3 class="Heading2">Example</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">From time to time&nbsp;a debtor (the person who owes money) may wish to replace his/her set of financial obligations with another set. &nbsp;On such occasions&nbsp;he/she must negotiate with his/her creditor (the person who is owed money) and agree upon a new due date and&nbsp;a new interest rate. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">This is generally achieved by evaluating each obligation in terms of the new due date&nbsp;and equating the sum of the old and the new obligations on the new date. &nbsp;The resultant equation of value is then solved to obtain the new future value which must be repaid on the new due date.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Mr More Money owes <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur5\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> due in one year&#39;s time and <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur2\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> due in two years time. &nbsp;Money is worth <span class="math-tex">\(12\%\)</span> per annum, compounded monthly.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">He decides to reschedule his payments by paying <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur3\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> six months from now&nbsp;and the rest fifteen months from now. &nbsp;What will his last payment be?</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Solution method</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">This example illustrates the replacement of one set of financial obligations with another equivalent set. &nbsp;Also note that in time value of money, <span class="Emphasis_1">payments</span> equal <span class="Emphasis_1">obligations</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">First, we represent the money on the timeline:</span></p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="260px" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/275.html" width="700px"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Second, we determine each payment on the new due date of 15 months hence.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><span class="Emphasis_1">Obligations</span>: There are two obligations, namely <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur5\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur2\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><span class="Emphasis_1">Payments</span>: There are two payments, namely <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur3\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur x\)</span>.</span></p>
