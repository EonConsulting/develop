<h3 class="Heading2">Random selection</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A political candidate wants to determine the opinions of the voters in his ward.<br />
He&nbsp;decides on a sample of size <span class="math-tex">\(20\)</span>. &nbsp;Using random numbers he chooses <span class="math-tex">\(20\)</span> telephone&nbsp;numbers from the telephone directory for a telephonic survey. &nbsp;Is this procedure correct to find a random sample? &nbsp;Why not?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Not all residents may have telephones&nbsp;and all the numbers of those who do have telephones&nbsp;may not be included in the telephone directory. &nbsp;Therefore such a sample cannot be considered to be random.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Randomly choosing the members of a sample is important because it helps prevent <span class="Emphasis_1">bias</span> in your results. Random selection allows <span class="Emphasis_1">impersonal choice</span> to choose the sample, rather than the individual performing the poll (the sampler) to choose his/her own participants, or self-selection of respondents as in a voluntary response poll. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">If a sampler does not use random selection, the sample will <span class="Emphasis_1">favour</span> the selection of <span class="Emphasis_1">certain groups</span>, possibly without the sampler even realising it.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Difficulties and cautions&nbsp;</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">In the real world, a truly random sample is difficult to achieve, but you can come&nbsp;close. &nbsp;One of the most difficult steps is obtaining a <span class="Emphasis_1">complete list</span> of every member&nbsp;in the population from which&nbsp;you want a sample.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">A <span class="Emphasis_1">telephone book</span> for a city is often used for sampling. &nbsp;Some of the problems associated with using a telephone book are that it excludes those who do not have a telephone, those who have unlisted numbers, and more recently relevant, those who use mobile&nbsp;phones instead of land lines.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">A second barrier to purely random samples is that it may be difficult or impossible to <span class="Emphasis_1">locate</span> some people in the population. &nbsp;For example, people who work unusual hours or who travel a lot may be chosen to be included in the sample, but are not available when you attempt to contact them.</span></p>
