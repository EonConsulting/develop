<h3 class="Heading2">Advantages of using formulas</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Suppose Mary has a house cleaning business, getting&nbsp;paid&nbsp;</span><span class="math-tex">\(\Cur285\Cdp00\)</span><span class="BodyText">&nbsp;per house in her&nbsp;neighbourhood. &nbsp;She wants to calculate&nbsp;the amount of money she&nbsp;can make. &nbsp;She can use the following&nbsp;</span>formula to&nbsp;calculate&nbsp;her&nbsp;income:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(i=\Cur285\Cdp00\times h\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">where <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> represents her&nbsp;income in rand and <span class="math-tex">\(h\)</span> the number of houses cleaned.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Note that there is no binding reason to use these specific symbols and we could in fact have written:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(R=\Cur285\Cdp00\times N\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">where&nbsp;</span><span class="math-tex">\(R\)</span><span class="BodyText">&nbsp;represents her&nbsp;income in rand and&nbsp;</span><span class="math-tex">\(N\)</span><span class="BodyText">&nbsp;the number of houses cleaned.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">So, what are some advantages of using formulas?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">A major advantage of formulas is their brevity. In addition, they can&nbsp;be easily manipulated.</span></p>
