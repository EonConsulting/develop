<h3 class="Heading2">Statistics</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Statistics are all around us. &nbsp;In fact it would be difficult to go through a full week without using statistics. Imagine watching a football game where no one kept score. &nbsp;<br />
The action itself might provide enough excitement to hold your attention for a while, but think of all the drama that would be lost if winning and losing were not an issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Imagine going to the grocery store and trying to find the best buy on a box of doggie treats for your dog, Fluffy. &nbsp;Without statistics this task would come down to simple guess work. &nbsp;You could never know for sure if you get the best (cheapest) treats for your rand. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Without statistics we could not plan our budgets, pay our taxes, enjoy games to their fullest, or&nbsp;evaluate classroom performance. &nbsp;Are you beginning to get the picture? &nbsp;<br />
We need statistics.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Two main statistical methodologies are used in data analysis, namely descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The most basic form of statistics is&nbsp;known as <span class="Emphasis_1">descriptive statistics</span>. &nbsp;This branch of statistics lays the foundation for all statistical knowledge. &nbsp;This makes it quite important, but it is not something that you should learn simply so you can use it in the distant future. &nbsp;Descriptive statistics can be used now, in English class, in Mathematics class, at the football stadium and in the grocery store. &nbsp;You probably already know more about statistics than you think.</span></p>
