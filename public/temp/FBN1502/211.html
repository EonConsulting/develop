<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">A <span class="Emphasis_1">system of linear equations in two variables</span> is just a set of two or more&nbsp;equations. &nbsp;The simplest case&nbsp;is&nbsp;two linear equations in two variables. &nbsp;The graph of such a system is a pair of lines in the Cartesian plane.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The <span class="Emphasis_1">solution</span> of a system of two linear equations can be <span class="Emphasis_1">classified</span> as follows:</span></li>
