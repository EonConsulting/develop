<h3 class="Heading2">Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Not many people can afford to buy a house or brand new car for cash. &nbsp;Most of us have to borrow money from a bank to make such a big purchase. &nbsp;</span><span class="BodyText">We usually repay such a loan to the bank over a long period of time in fixed payments which include interest on the amount still owed to the bank.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The loan is said to be amortised when all liabilities,&nbsp;that is both the principal (the amount of the loan) and interest, are paid by a sequence of equal payments made at equal intervals of time.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Typical questions that we may ask about this process are:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="BodyText">What should the amount of the equal payments be?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="BodyText">What is the remaining value of the loan still to be repaid at any stage during its repayment? &nbsp;</span></span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="BodyText">What is the total interest payable on the loan?</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>These may sound like difficult questions to answer, but if you consider that this way of paying back a loan is just&nbsp;an ordinary annuity, the good news is that you already have the tools&nbsp;to answer these questions!&nbsp;</p>
