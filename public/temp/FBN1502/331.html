<h3 class="Heading2">Present and future values</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">To understand the time value of money, we need to consider the present and future value concepts. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">If <span class="math-tex">\( P\)</span> is invested at an interest rate of <span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> per period for a term of length <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb n\)</span> <span class="PalAb">periods</span>, it accumulates to</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\( \PalBc S=\PalAa P(1+i)^\PalAb n\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">and we call <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa P\)</span> the <span class="PalAa">present value</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc S\)</span> the <span class="PalBc">future value</span> of the investment.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Sometimes&nbsp;we are given the <span class="PalBc">future value</span> <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc S\)</span> and wish to know the <span class="PalAa">present value</span> <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa P\)</span>. &nbsp;To do this&nbsp;we can rearrange the above formula as follows:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align} \PalBc S&amp;=\PalAa P(1+i)^\PalAb n\\ \PalAa P\times(1+i)^\PalAb n&amp;=\PalBc S\\ \PalAa P &amp;=\PalBc S\div(1+i)^\PalAb n\\ \PalAa P &amp;=\PalBc S\times(1+i)^{-\PalAb n} \end{align}\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">In this&nbsp;latter case&nbsp;of finding the <span class="PalAa">present value</span> of some <span class="PalBc">future value</span>, the <span class="PalAa">present value</span> <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa {PV}\)</span> is often referred to as the discounted value of the future sum&nbsp;and the factor <span class="math-tex">\((1+i)^{-\PalAb n}\)</span> is termed the discount factor.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">This must not be confused with simple discounting&nbsp;for which a discount rate is defined. &nbsp;The rate used in compound discounting is simply the relevant interest rate. &nbsp;It would indeed be possible to introduce a compound discount rate, but this is not used in practice since it does not have a readily understood meaning.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The important concepts are those of <span class="PalAa">present value</span> and <span class="PalBc">future value</span>&nbsp;and the fact that the process of determining present value is often referred to as discounting.</span></p>
