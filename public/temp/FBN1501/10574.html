<h3 class="Heading2">Relative frequency</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">We might not just be interested in the absolute frequencies, but instead in how these numbers relate to each other. &nbsp;In other words we might want to know the proportion of distances in each interval in order to&nbsp;understand how many distances from each interval make up the whole. &nbsp;This is called the relative frequency.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For example, <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span> out of <span class="math-tex">\(80\)</span> distances are in the first interval:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle\frac{4}{80}=0\Ndp0500\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(0\Ndp05\)</span> is the proportion of distances from the first interval.</span></p>
