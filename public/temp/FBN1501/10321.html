<p><span class="BodyText">A very useful diagram which is easy to set up is a stem-and-leaf diagram.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Data can be shown in a variety of ways including graphs, charts and tables. &nbsp;A stem-and-leaf diagram is a type of graph that is similar to a histogram but shows more information. &nbsp;A stem-and-leaf diagram&nbsp;summarises the shape of a set of data (the distribution) and provides extra detail regarding individual values.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The data is arranged by place value. &nbsp;Each data value is split into a <span>leaf</span> (usually the <span>last digit</span>) and a <span>stem</span> (the <span>other digits</span>). &nbsp;The stem values are listed down and the leaf values are listed next to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">In this way the <span>stem groups the values</span> and each <span>leaf indicates a particular value</span> within the <span>group</span>. &nbsp;The leaves are displayed to the right of the stem. &nbsp;Stem-and-leaf diagrams are great organisers for large amounts of information.</span></p>
