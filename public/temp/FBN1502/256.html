<h3 class="Heading2">Defining a system of linear equations in two variables</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">What is a <span class="Emphasis_1">system of linear equations in two variables</span>?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">It is a set or collection of linear equations whose common solutions are looked for. &nbsp;The simplest linear system is one with two equations and two variables. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We can also refer to this kind of system&nbsp;as&nbsp;<span class="Emphasis_1">simultaneous linear equations</span>&nbsp;or a <span class="Emphasis_1">linear system</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Consider the following system with two linear equations and two variables:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa{y=\displaystyle\frac{5}{2}x-5}\)</span>&nbsp;and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb{y=-x+1}\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Since the two equations are in a system, we work with them at the same time. &nbsp;In particular, we can graph them together on the same set of axes:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="BodyText">A solution for a single equation is any point that lies on the line for that equation. &nbsp;A solution for a system of equations is any point that lies on each line in the system. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="BodyText">For example, note the following three points on the graph:&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span class="Bullet_List_2">The&nbsp;<span class="PalBa">turquoise&nbsp;point</span> is not a solution of the system, because it is not on either line.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span class="Bullet_List_2">The&nbsp;<span class="PalBb">purple point</span> is also not a solution of the system, because it lies on only one of the lines, not on both of them.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span class="Bullet_List_2">The <span class="PalBc">green&nbsp;point</span> is a solution of the system, because it lies on both of the lines. &nbsp;In particular, this point is the intersection of the two lines. &nbsp;Since this point is on both lines,&nbsp;it satisfies (or is a solution of) both equations. &nbsp;So it satisfies the entire system of equations.</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="BodyText">You can confirm the solution by plugging it into the system of equations&nbsp;and confirming that the solution satisfies each equation.</span></p>
