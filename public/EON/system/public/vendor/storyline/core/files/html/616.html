    <h2>From individual demand to market demand</h2>
    <p>The individual household is one of the most important building blocks and
      much can be learned from the behaviour of an individual household.&nbsp;
      However, suppliers are more interested in the market demand for the good
      and service since the market demand gives them a better idea of the
      quantities they can expect to sell. The market demand represents the total
      demand for a good or service during a certain period. In market system,
      the market demand is one of the fundamental forces that determines the
      market price of a good or services, and we therefore need to study it in
      more detail. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To move from individual demand to market demand is quite simple.&nbsp; All
      that needs to be done is to add the individual demands together.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that the demand for fried chicken not only consists of the demand
      by our students, which forms a household because they make joint
      decisions, but also the Khumalo and Venter families, and that their demand
      for fried chicken pieces is known, the market demand can be arrived at as
      demonstrated in the following table:</p>
    <p class="table-title">Table 3 Market demand schedule for fried chicken pieces</p>
    <table style="width: 100%; height: 100pt;" border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr style="height: 100%;">
          <td>Price <br>
            (R)</td>
          <td>Quantity demanded by students </td>
          <td>Quantity demanded by the Khumalos</td>
          <td>Quantity demanded by the Venters</td>
          <td>Market quantity demanded</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>42</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>14</td>
          <td>16</td>
          <td>18</td>
          <td>48</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>At R7, the market quantity demanded is 2 by the students, +4 by the
      Khumalos and +6 by the Venters, which gives us 12 pieces.&nbsp; Following
      the same procedure for the rest of the prices, the market quantity
      demanded at R6 is 18, at R5 it is 24, at R4 it is 30, at R3 it is 36, at
      R2 it is 42 and at R1 it is 48. 
    </p>
    <p>
      From the data in the table we can draw the market demand curve for fried
      chicken pieces. This market demand curve is also downward sloping showing
      the negative or inverse relationship between the price and the quantity
      demanded.&nbsp;
