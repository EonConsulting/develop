<h3 class="Heading2">Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The concept of marginal cost is very important in the theory of economics.<br />
<span class="PalBb">Marginal cost</span> is the change in <span class="PalBc">total cost</span> that comes from making or producing one additional item.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition"><span class="PalBb">Marginal cost</span> is defined as the cost that results<br />
		from a one unit increase in the production rate.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">So if a company has already produced <span class="math-tex">\(13\)</span> cars, the <span class="PalBb">marginal cost</span> of the <span class="math-tex">\(14^{\text{th}}\)</span> car is only the additional costs the company incurs in making that car.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Expanding scale of production</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A company can have cost advantages by expanding their scale of production.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The cost of producing something can fall as the volume of its output increases. &nbsp;Hence it might cost <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur3\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> to produce <span class="math-tex">\(100\)</span> copies of a magazine, but only <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur4\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> to produce <span class="math-tex">\(1\Tsp000\)</span> copies. &nbsp;The cost in this case has fallen from <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur30\Cdp00\)</span> to <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur4\Cdp00\)</span> a copy, because the main elements of cost in producing a magazine, that is editorial and design, are unrelated to the number of magazines produced.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The aim is to reduce the production cost per unit as production increases.<br />
In other words:</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">The cost of producing an additional unit, the&nbsp;<span class="PalBb">marginal<br />
		cost,&nbsp;</span>decreases as the volume of production increases.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h3 class="Heading3">Optimum production level</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The purpose of analysing marginal cost is to determine at what point a company can operate at an optimum production level.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Companies constantly examine the cost implication of adding one more unit to their production schedules. &nbsp;This is because&nbsp;at some point, the benefit of producing one additional unit and generating revenue from that item will bring the overall cost of producing the product line down.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">The key to optimizing manufacturing costs is to<br />
		find this&nbsp;point or level as quickly as possible.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
