<h3 class="Heading2">Graphing of functions</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">We have all&nbsp;heard bold statements and predictions such as the following on the news and in advertisements:</span>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">&quot;Fluoride toothpaste prevents cavities.&quot;</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">&quot;<span class="math-tex">\(45\Tsp000\)</span> university graduates will buy new cars in December.&quot;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="BodyText">Have you ever stopped to wonder how these claims were reached? &nbsp;How was it concluded that smoking and cancer are related? &nbsp;How can it be&nbsp;predicted how many new cars will be sold?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">To help making such predictions, we can use functions. &nbsp;We can graph these functions as well.</span></p>

		between variables.&nbsp;A graph basically summarizes <em>how&nbsp;one<br />

<p><span class="BodyText">Graphs and functions are very useful in the financial world. &nbsp;A function is the mathematical expression that describes the relationship between two or more variables. &nbsp;By graphing the function you show the relationship in a picture.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">In real life, whenever a relationship between two variables exists and is known, one variable can be used to guess the other. &nbsp;You sometimes see in the media a graph with a straight line that is going up or down. &nbsp;What does this mean? A straight line shows you a picture of the relationship between two variables and helps you to make predictions.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">An example is the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity consumers are willing to buy. &nbsp;At lower prices, consumers may be willing to buy more, but buy less as prices increase.</span></p>
