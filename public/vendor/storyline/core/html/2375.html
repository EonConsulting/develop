        <p>It is also possible to demonstrate the law of supply by using a graph. To
            do this, you have to use the information in the supply schedule. Study the
            following graph to see how the information in the table is plotted as
            points. When the points are joined, we have a supply curve.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            The <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a graph="graph1" src="../images/297.svg">vertical axis</a></span> shows the price
            (P) of a product or service, for example, fried chicken pieces, and it is
            labelled “Price”. The <span style="color: #3366ff;"><a graph="graph1" src="../images/298.svg">horizontal axis</a></span>
            measures the quantity supplied (Qs) and it is labelled “Quantity
            supplied”.</p>

        <p>The first point corresponds to a price (P) of R7 and a quantity (Qs) of
            14 pieces of fried chicken, as can be seen from the vertical axis and
            horizontal axis respectively.</p>

        <!--    <img class="graph1 right" src="../images/306.svg">-->
        <!--    <p>&lt;insert interactive graph [UECA-297[DSP51] – [UECA-306][DSP60]<br>
              Layout: Float right<br>
              Interaction: click on event. Student clicks on each letter in the table
              and the graph is constructed step by step. Begin with completed graph on
              screen. First click on ‘the vertical axis’ etc.&gt;</p>-->
        <p>To obtain the second point, we obtain the point that represents a price
            of R6 and a quantity of 12. To draw the next points, we obtain the point
            that represents a price of R5 and a quantity of 10; the point that
            represents a price of R4 and a quantity supplied of 8; and so on.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            By <a graph="graph1" src="../images/306.svg">connecting these points</a>, we obtain a line (shown as S). This, then, is
            our supply curve for fried chicken pieces.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            Look carefully at the supply curve above. Can you see how the supply curve
            is labelled S? The supply curve shows how many pieces of fried chicken
            producers are planning to sell at each price. As you can see, the supply
            curve slopes upwards from left to right, showing a positive relationship
            between the price and quantity supplied.</p>
