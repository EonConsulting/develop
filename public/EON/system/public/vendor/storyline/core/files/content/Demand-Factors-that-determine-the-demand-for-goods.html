	<li>the price of the product (represented by the symbol Px)</li>
	<li>the number of potential buyers (represented by the symbol N)</li>
	<li>the price of related goods (represented by the symbol Pg)</li>
	<li>substitutes</li>
	<li>compliments</li>
	<li>other factors such as
	<ul>
		<li>the weather</li>
		<li>expected prices</li>
