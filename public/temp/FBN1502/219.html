<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Since most business problems deal with positive quantities, we shall be concerned mainly with points in the first quadrant. &nbsp;If&nbsp;we however regard losses as negative profits, deductions as negative additions, deficits as negative income, and so on, we shall also have the occasion to work with points in the other three quadrants.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Whenever reading&nbsp;a graph, you carefully establish the variables represented on each axis and the relevant scales.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Always label the axes clearly. Remember the variables you&nbsp;draw on the axes need not be <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>, but could be any variables, for example <span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(B\)</span> or <span class="math-tex">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(x_2\)</span>.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">According to the definition of a function, a function assigns one value of <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> to each value of <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> for all the values that <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> may assume. &nbsp;Thus an ordered pair of data which we can write as <span class="math-tex">\((x;y)\)</span> is established. &nbsp;Each of these pairs corresponds to a point in the plane. &nbsp;If we plotted all these points we would obtain what is called a graph of a given function.</span></li>

		<p class="Definition">In other words, the graph of the function <span class="math-tex">\(y=f(x)\)</span> consists of all ordered pairs <span class="math-tex">\((x;y)\)</span> which satisfy <span class="math-tex">\(y=f(x)\)</span>. &nbsp;We speak of the coordinates <span class="math-tex">\((x;y)\)</span> of each point <span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>, and call <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> the abscissa and <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> the ordinate of <span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>.</p>

<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">It is not only points on the graph of <span class="math-tex">\(y=f(x)\)</span> which may be referred to in this way. &nbsp;Any point in the plane is located by the specification of an ordered pair of numbers <span class="math-tex">\((x;y)\)</span>. &nbsp;That is in fact why we refer to a rectangular coordinate system.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The linear function&nbsp;is the most elementary, and perhaps the most important, of all functions.</span></li>
