<h3 class="Heading2">Definition</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">If the mayor is asked to provide a single value which best describes the income level of the city, he or she would answer with a measure of central tendency.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The mean (or average) is the most popular and well known measure of central tendency. &nbsp;It can be used with both discrete and continuous data.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">The mean is equal to the sum of all the values in the data set<br />
		&nbsp;divided by the number of values in the data set.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">This is called the arithmetic mean. &nbsp;To calculate the arithmetic mean, sum the values and divide by their quantity.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The first three examples illustrated below show higher values dragging the mean upward. &nbsp;The final example piles on some low values to drag the mean downward.<br />
What you see is characteristic of the arithmetic mean. &nbsp;Any value added above or below the mean will move the mean in the direction of the new value. The move may be slight, or it may be large, but it will be non-zero.</span></p>
