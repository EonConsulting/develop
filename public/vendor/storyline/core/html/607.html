        <h2>An economist’s definition of demand</h2>
        <p>
            The concept “demand” means different things to different 
            people and economists attach a particular meaning to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            When we dealt with the economic problem of scarcity we indicated that that this problem is the result of our 
            unlimited needs and wants that have outstripped our limited resources.  This is not the same as saying 
            that our demand for goods and services is unlimited.  We all have unlimited needs and wants, but not all of 
            us have the ability or necessary purchasing power to buy the goods and services we need and want.  And, 
            according to economists, if you do not have the purchasing power to back up your need or want, you are not 
            part of the demand for a good or service.

            <div class="col s6">
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;">For traders demand is the willingness and ability to buy stocks and shares</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col s6">
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size:13px;">Protestors also have demands but these are not what we study in economics</p>

        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:0px;">
            It is this condition to be able to purchase or ability to pay that gives weight to the economist's definition of demand.  
            This ability to pay for goods and services, in turn, depends on income. The higher the income of a person or household, 
            the more goods and services they can afford to buy, and the more needs and wants they can satisfy.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In economics, we say that a person has the necessary <strong>purchasing power</strong>. Hence to be part of the 
            demand for a good or service, you must have the necessary purchasing power.  Without the ability to pay for a 
            good or service, you are excluded from the market. Is this fair?  Think about it. We will return to this topic later.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are thinking about starting your own business, remember the following: 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
            If you plan to sell a good or service, you must be sure that people not only want it, but are also willing and have 
            the ability to pay for it. If people want a good or service but do not have the ability to pay for it, they are not 
            part of the demand for it. Moreover, if there is no demand for it, then you will not be able to make a profit and 
            your business will fail.  For example, only those people who want a car and are willing and able to pay for it, create 
            the demand for cars. 
        </p>
        <p>
            An economist would define the demand for a good or service as follows: 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
            <i>Demand is the quantities of a good or service that potential buyers are 
                willing and able to purchase during a certain period</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first aspect of the definition that you should note is that it refers to the quantities of a good or service 
            (i.e. how much of a good or service is demanded). We will use the symbol <strong>Q<sub>d</sub></strong> to denote quantity demanded. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Potential buyers refer to the intentions of the buyers of the good or service and not what they actually do.  
        </p>

        <p class="video-intro">
            Watch the following video clip for more on the importance of the intentions of buyers:
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            Willing to purchase refers to the condition that you are willing to pay for it.  If you want something and you have 
            the means to pay for it but you are not willing to pay the price for it, you are not part of the demand for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then there is the important qualification that you must be able to purchase the good or service.  
        </p>
        <p class="video-intro">
            Watch the following clip for more on willingness and ability to buy: 
        </p>

        <p>
            The last part of the definition deals with the time period. For demand to be meaningful, it is necessary for the 
            time period to be stated as the quantity demanded per day, per week, per month and so on.  For instance, saying 
            that the quantity of tomatoes demanded is ten tons per week is significantly different from saying it is ten tons per year. 
        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
            The main aspects of an economist's definition of demand are therefore as follows: 
        </p>
        <div class="row no-padding" style="margin-bottom:-10px;">
            <div class="col m6 s12">
                <ul>
                    <li>It differs from needs and wants</li>
                    <li>It indicates willingness to purchase</li>
                    <li>It indicates ability to purchase</li>
                    <li>It is for a specified period</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
