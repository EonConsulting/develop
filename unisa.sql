Evolutionary processes give rise to biodiversity at every level of biological organisation, including the levels of species, individual organisms, and molecules.</p><p>Repeated formation of new species (speciation), change within species (anagenesis), and loss of species (extinction) throughout the evolutionary history of life on Earth are demonstrated by shared sets of morphological and biochemical traits, including shared DNA sequences. These shared traits are more similar among species that share a more recent common ancestor, and can be used to reconstruct a biological &quot;tree of life&quot; based on evolutionary relationships (phylogenetics), using both existing species and fossils. The fossil record includes a progression from early biogenic graphite, to microbial mat fossils, to fossilised multicellular organisms. Existing patterns of biodiversity have been shaped both by speciation and by extinction.</p><p>In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin formulated the scientific theory of evolution by natural selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations:</p><ol><li>traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation),</li><li>different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and</li><li>traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.</li></ol>','science,natural,animals,nature,evolution',1,'2017-09-08 13:41:15','2017-09-19 09:21:16','Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.',NULL),(18,'LTI Test','<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/W7qWa52k-nE\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>','maths,math,mathematics,number,numbers',1,'2017-09-08 13:54:40','2017-09-08 13:54:40','Numrical Methods',NULL),(19,'Demonstration','<div class=\"appframe\"><iframe allowtransparency=\"true\" class=\"ckeditorframev2\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"750\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"/ajaxresponse/40\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','maths,math,mathematics,number,numbers,algebra,variables,unknown',1,'2017-09-12 08:47:34','2017-09-12 08:51:01','This is a cool demo content thing',NULL),(27,'Python','<h1>Introduction to Python</h1>\n<p>Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
