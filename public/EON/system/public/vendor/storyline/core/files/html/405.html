    <h2>Decisions Today Impact on Our Future</h2>
    <p>A key issue that can be illustrated by the production possibilities curve
      is how the decisions we make today have an impact on our future.</p>
    <p>An important decision that any society needs to make is how many
      resources to devote to the production of capital goods and how many
      resources to devote to the production of consumer goods.</p>
    <p class="activity-intro">Look at the list of goods below. Which of these are capital goods and which of these are consumer goods? Select each of the goods that you think are capital goods and then press 'submit'.</p>

    <img class="right width50" alt="Capital goods" src="355.svg">Capital
    goods are our man-made resources and are used in the production of other
    goods. Examples include all types of machinery, plant and equipment used in
    manufacturing and construction, school buildings, university residences,
    roads, dams and bridges. Capital goods do not themselves yield direct
    consumer satisfaction, but they do permit more production and satisfaction
    in the future.
    <p>Consumer goods are used or consumed by individuals or households (i.e.
      consumers) to satisfy needs and wants. Examples include food, wine,
      clothing, shoes, furniture, household appliances and motor cars.</p>
    <p><img class="right width50" alt="Consumer goods" src="356.svg">The
      trade-off society faces is whether it should allocate more resources to
      satisfy needs and wants in the current period, or whether it should
      allocate more resources to the creation of capital goods that will make it
      possible to create more consumer goods and services in the future. In
      other words, should society sacrifice current consumption to increase
      future consumption?</p>
    <p>This trade-off can be illustrated by the production possibilities curves
      for country A and country B depicted below.</p>
    <p>The production of capital goods is represented on the vertical axis,
      while the production of consumer goods is represented on the horizontal
      axis.</p>

    </div>
      <p>Country A decides to allocate resources not only for the replacement
        of worn-out capital, but also to create new capital goods. This is
        indicated by point A. At this point the quantity of consumer goods is
        equal to C<sub>1</sub>.</p>
      <p>Country B, however, decides to allocate resources only for the
        replacement of worn-out capital. This is indicated by point B. At this
        point, the quantity of consumer goods is equal to C<sub>2</sub>.</p>
      <img src="2658.png">
      <p style="text-align:center;">Allocation of resources between capital and consumer goods</p>
      <p>In the current period, people in country B have more consumer goods
        (C<sub>2</sub>) than the people in country A (C<sub>1</sub>) and they
        can therefore satisfy more needs and wants. We can therefore say they
        have a higher standard of living.</p>
      <p>Over time, however, this position will change.</p>
      <p>The production possibilities curve for country B will stay the same
        because the country only produces sufficient capital goods to replace
        worn-out capital goods and there will be no change in the people's
        standard of living.</p>
        <img src="2659.png">
      <p style="text-align:center;">Production possibilities for country B stay the same</p>
      <p>The production possibilities curve for country A will shift outwards
        in the future because the country increased its capital goods, which
        makes it possible for it to produce more consumer goods. And as long
        as this country continues to allocate resources in this way, the
        production possibilities curve will shift outwards and economic growth
        will occur and the standard of living will increase and eventually
        overtake that of country B.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;">Production possibilities for country A increases</p>
