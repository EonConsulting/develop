<p><span class="BodyText">When a line with zero slope is graphed, the result is a horizontal line. &nbsp;One thing to be aware of is that horizontal lines can be at different </span><span class="Emphasis_1">heights</span><span class="BodyText">. &nbsp;For example, in the sketch below you see three horizontal lines. In each case&nbsp;the slope is zero:</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Notice&nbsp;the equations of the lines on the left-hand side of the sketch. &nbsp;They are all similar in that they all look like <span class="math-tex">\(y = \text{some value}\)</span>. &nbsp;Just like a flat road, a horizontal line does not progress, or change, in the vertical,&nbsp;or <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>, direction. &nbsp;Every point on the line has the same <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>&nbsp;value.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Note the horizontal line in the sketch above. &nbsp;The <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-coordinate of every point on the&nbsp;horizontal line is <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>. &nbsp;The <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>-coordinate can have any value.</span></p>
