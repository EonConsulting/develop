        <h2>Types of price elasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we know how price elasticity is calculated by dividing the percentage change in
            quantity demanded by the percentage change in price, we need to interpret different price
            elasticity coefficients.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you look at the table below, which gives you the price elasticities of demand for various goods
            and services, you will notice that the price elasticity ranges from 0,1 for salt to 4,68 for fresh
            tomatoes.

        <p>
            What is the meaning of the difference between a price elasticity of 0,1 for salt and 4,6 for fresh
            tomatoes? Is this difference important?
        </p>
        <p>
            An important difference is that a price elasticity of 0,1 for salt indicates that a 1% change in the
            price of salt will cause a 0,1 % change in the quantity demanded, while a price elasticity of 4,6
            for fresh tomatoes indicates that a 1% change in price will cause a 4,6% change in the quantity
            demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on this, we can say that in the case of salt, a change in the price has a smaller effect on
            the quantity demanded, and consumers are less sensitive to a change in the price of salt
            compared to a change in the price of fresh tomatoes.

        </div>
        <p>
            Another difference is that in the case of salt, the price elasticity is less than 1, while for fresh
            tomatoes, the price elasticity is greater than 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, if you look at the table again, you will notice that goods and services can be classified as
            having a price elasticity of less than 1 or more than 1.

            Let’s look at our formula for price elasticity:

        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class="col s12">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            When the percentage change in price is greater than the percentage change in quantity
            demanded, the price elasticity will be less than 1. If the percentage change in price is smaller
            than the percentage change in quantity demanded, the price elasticity will be greater than 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, we can state the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            If the percentage change in price is greater than the percentage change in quantity
            demanded, then the price elasticity coefficient is less than 1. This applies to things such as salt,
            medical services, fuel, beer and so forth.

            private education, restaurant meals and fresh tomatoes.

            What we will identify and describe in the rest of this section are the different types of elasticity.
            These are based on the varying impact of a change in price on the quantity demanded, as
            measured by the price elasticity coefficient.

        <h3>
            A relatively inelastic demand
        </h3>
        <p>
            The first type of elasticity we take a closer look at is known as a relatively inelastic demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of a relatively inelastic demand, the percentage change in price is greater than the
            percentage change in quantity demanded. And when the percentage change in price is
            greater than the percentage change in quantity demanded, the price elasticity coefficient will
            have a value of less than 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words:
        </p>
        <p class="center-align">
            If <i>e<sub>p</sub></i> &lt; 1, we have a relatively inelastic demand.
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class="col s12">
                <img src="70.svg" class="centered-graph"> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            In our table, goods and services with a relatively inelastic demand are things such as
            salt, medical care, tobacco products and petrol (fuel). They all have an elasticity coefficient of
            less than 1. What this means is that the quantity demanded is not highly sensitive to a change in
            the price.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the basis of this, we can argue that people are relatively unresponsive or insensitive to
            adjusting their quantity demanded if the price changes. Note that unresponsive and insensitive
            in this sense means that people find it difficult to change their quantity demanded of the good,
            and not that they do not become upset if the price changes. In the case of fuel, which has a
            price elasticity of 0,6 in the table, this implies that a 10% rise in the price of fuel will reduce the
            quantity demanded by 6% – which is less than the percentage change in price. This is referred to
            as a <strong>relatively inelastic demand.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Relatively elastic demand
        </h3>
        <p>
            Where the percentage change in price is smaller than the percentage change in quantity
            demanded, we have a relatively elastic demand. Whenever the percentage change in price is
            smaller than the percentage change in quantity demanded, the price elasticity coefficient will
            have a value of more than 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words:
        </p>
        <p class="center-align">
            If <em><strong>e</strong></em><sub>p</sub> > 1 we have a relatively elastic demand.
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class="col s12">

        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:0;">
            In our table, goods and services with a relatively elastic demand are things such as
            private education, motor vehicles, restaurant meals and fresh tomatoes. They all have an
            elasticity coefficient of more than 1. What this means is that the quantity demanded is extremely
            sensitive to a change in the price. On the basis of this, we can argue that people are relatively
            responsive or sensitive to adjusting their quantity demanded if the price changes. In the case of
            private education, which has a price elasticity of 1,1, this implies that a 10% rise in the price of
            private education will decrease the quantity demanded by 11% – the percentage change in
            price is less than the percentage change in quantity demanded. This is then referred to as a
            <strong>relatively elastic demand</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            But what if the percentage change in Q<sub>d</sub> = the percentage change in P?
        </p>
        <h3>
            Unitary elasticity
        </h3>
        <p>
            Where the percentage change in price is equal to the percentage change in quantity
            demanded, the price elasticity coefficient is equal to 1. In other words, a 1% increase in price
            leads to a 1% decrease in quantity demanded, giving us a price elasticity coefficient of 1. This is
            called <strong>unitary elasticity.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words:
        </p>
        <p class="center-align">
            If <em><strong>e</strong></em><sub>p</sub> = 1, we have a unitary elastic demand.
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class="col s12">

        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:0;">
            If you examine the table, you can see that shoes are close to unitary elasticity. Most goods and
            services in the table, however, either have an elasticity of less than 1 or more than 1.

            Some extreme cases
        </h3>
        <p>
            Thus far we have identified three types of elasticity, namely relatively price inelastic (e<sub>p</sub> <1),
            unitary elastic (e<sub>p</sub> = 1) and relatively elastic (e<sub>p</sub> >1). There are two other interesting theoretical
            types, namely perfectly inelastic and perfectly elastic.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Perfectly inelastic demand
        </h3>
        <p>
            A perfectly inelastic demand curve occurs when a change in price does not have any impact
            on the quantity demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of our formula, the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to 0.
        </p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s7 offset-s5">
                <img src="../assets/77.svg" class="responsive-img"> 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Here the price elasticity coefficient is equal to zero since the percentage change in quantity
            demanded is 0, and when you divide 0 by any value, the answer is still 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            This kind of elasticity might occur when people are highly addicted to some kind of drug or need
            life-saving medication.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Perfectly elastic demand
        </h3>
        <p>
            A perfectly elastic demand curve occurs when a small change in price has a major impact on
            the quantity demanded. Here, a small percentage change in price causes a percentage
            change in the quantity demanded that approaches infinity.
