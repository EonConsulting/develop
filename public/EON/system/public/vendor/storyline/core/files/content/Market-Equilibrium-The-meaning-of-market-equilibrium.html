<h2>THE MEANING OF MARKET EQUILIBRIUM</h2>

<p>You now know what supply and demand curves look like and what they stand for, but when you examine these curves on their own, you will still not know precisely at what price fried chicken pieces will be traded on the market. We merely analysed various hypothetical prices to see how consumers (as demanders) and producers (as suppliers) will react to them. Hence the exact prices at which transactions will be concluded have yet to be determined.</p>

<p>In a competitive market, the market price is set by the interaction of the forces of demand and supply, and at such a level, that the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. This is referred to as the equilibrium price and once this price is reached, we have market equilibrium. At this market equilibrium price, the plans of the buyers match the plans of the sellers.</p>

<p>Watch the following clip on the meaning of equilibrium:</p>

<p>An equilibrium position indicates a position of rest, because the behaviour of both buyers and suppliers is unchanging (at rest). At an equilibrium price, buyers are able to purchase the quantity of a product they plan to buy, and suppliers are supplying the quantity of a product they plan to supply.</p>
