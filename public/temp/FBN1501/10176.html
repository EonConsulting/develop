<h3 class="Heading2">Definition</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">One way to think of a fraction is as a division that has not been done yet. &nbsp;Why do we even use fractions? &nbsp;Why do we not just divide the two numbers and use the decimal instead? &nbsp;In this day of cheap calculators, this&nbsp;is a very good question.<br />
Fractions were invented long before decimal numbers&nbsp;as a way of showing portions less than one&nbsp;and they are still around. &nbsp;They are used in cooking, building, sewing, the stock market -&nbsp;they are everywhere&nbsp;and we need to understand them.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Remember, the number above the bar is called the numerator&nbsp;and the number below the bar is called the denominator.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align}\displaystyle\frac{\PalAa3}{\PalAb4}&amp;&amp;\displaystyle\frac{\PalAa{\text{numerator}}}{\PalAb{\text{denominator}}}\end{align}\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We can read this fraction as &quot;three fourths&quot;, &quot;three over four&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;three divided by four&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Every fraction can be converted to a decimal by dividing. &nbsp;If you use a calculator to divide <span class="math-tex">\(3\)</span> by <span class="math-tex">\(4\)</span>, you will find that it is equal to <span class="math-tex">\(0\Ndp75\)</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\displaystyle\frac{3}{4}=0\Ndp75\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Remember, you can find the decimal equivalent of any fraction by dividing. &nbsp;Here are some other fractions and their decimal equivalents:&nbsp;</span></p>
