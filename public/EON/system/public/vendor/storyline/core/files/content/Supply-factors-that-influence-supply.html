<h2>FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE SUPPLY</h2>

<p>All businesses that supply goods and services have to make a number of difficult decisions about the kinds, amounts and prices of the goods and services they wish to supply.</p>

<p>In a market system, businesses only supply goods and services that can make a profit. Likewise, a business will not supply a good or service that cannot make a profit. Even if there is a demand for a good or service, it will only be supplied if a profit can be made.</p>

<p>Consequently, the government or other non-profit enterprises usually supply goods and services that private firms regard as unprofitable.</p>

<p>Economists agree that the following factors are the main determinants of the supply of a good or service:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the price of a good or service (represented by the symbol P<sub>x</sub>)</li>
	<li>the prices of inputs, also known as the cost of production (represented by the symbol P<sub>c</sub>)</li>
	<li>the prices of alternative goods and services (represented by the symbol P<sub>g</sub>)</li>
	<li>the technology needed to make the good (represented by the symbol T)</li>
	<li>the number of suppliers (represented by the symbol N)</li>
	<li>the weather</li>
	<li>expected prices</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the price of the good or service and the number of suppliers, all the other factors are mainly concerned with the cost of production. A firm&rsquo;s supply decision therefore mainly depends on the cost of production and the profits that it can make by supplying the good or service.</p>

<p>Do the following activity about the factors that impact on the supply:</p>
