<h3 class="Heading2">Introduction</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Often it is not possible to list all the data or draw a histogram. &nbsp;It would be nice to have one number which best represents a data set. &nbsp;Often where the data lies is of interest, for which purpose a measure of location is useful.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>

		<p class="Definition">A measure of central tendency is a&nbsp;single value that attempts to describe<br />
		a set of data by identifying&nbsp;the central position within that set of data.</p>

	</tr>

<p><span class="BodyText">As such, measures of central tendency are sometimes called measures of central location.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The mean (often called the average) is most likely the measure of central tendency that you are most familiar with, but there are others, such as the median and the mode.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Valid measures of central tendency:</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span class="Bullet_List_2">Mean</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span class="Bullet_List_2">Median</span></li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><span class="Bullet_List_2">Mode</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="BodyText">Under different conditions, some measures of central tendency become more appropriate to use than others.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">It is important to consider&nbsp;the mean, mode and median,&nbsp;how to calculate them and under what conditions they are most appropriate to be used.</span></p>
