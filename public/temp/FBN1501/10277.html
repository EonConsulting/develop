<h3 class="Heading2">Repetition</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Consider the lock below which uses three digits for its code:</span></p>

<p class="Image">
<img alt="" src="/FBN1501/assets/400.svg" style="width: 350px; height: 350px;" /></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Suppose it has a code of <span class="math-tex">\(461\)</span>. &nbsp;Order is important because <span class="math-tex">\(614\)</span> differs from <span class="math-tex">\(461\)</span> and the lock will not open. &nbsp;It has to be <span class="math-tex">\(4-6-1\)</span>. &nbsp;Therefore, we can say the lock uses a permutation of numbers.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For a lock like this, you can use <span class="math-tex">\(222\)</span> as a code as well. &nbsp;Therefore, we say that repetition is allowed. &nbsp;Once the two is used, you can use it again.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For permutations with repetition:</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">When you have <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n\)</span> things to choose from and repetition is allowed,<br />
		you have <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n\)</span> choices each time.<br />
		<br />
		When choosing <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb r\)</span> of them, the number of permutations is:<br />
		<span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n \times \PalBc n \times \ldots \times\PalBc n \)</span>&nbsp;(<span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb r\)</span>&nbsp;times)<br />
		<br />
		It is easier to write it&nbsp;by using an exponent of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb r\)</span>&nbsp;as follows:<br />
		Write&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n \times \PalBc n \times \ldots \times\PalBc n \)</span>&nbsp;<span>(</span><span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb r\)</span><span>&nbsp;times) as&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n^\PalAb r\)</span>.</span></p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">In other words, there are <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n\)</span> possibilities for the first choice, then&nbsp;there are <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n\)</span> possibilities for the second choice, and so on, multiplying each time.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Consider the lock above again. &nbsp;For each of the <span class="PalAb">three</span> positions in the code, we can choose from <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc{10}\)</span> different digits, namely&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(0,1,\ldots9\)</span>. &nbsp;Thus there are:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc{10}\times\PalBc{10}\times\PalBc{10}=\PalBc{10}^\PalAb3=1\Tsp000\)</span>&nbsp;permutations.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">In this case <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc n\)</span> (the number of things to choose from) is <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc{10}\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb r\)</span> (the number of times you choose a digit) equals <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb3\)</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We see <span class="Emphasis_1">repetition</span> is allowed and <span class="Emphasis_1">order</span> matters.</span></p>
