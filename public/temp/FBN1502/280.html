<h3 class="Heading2">Example</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Apart from systems of two inequalities in two unknowns, it is quite feasible&nbsp;and often necessary in practice, to consider systems with a greater number of inequalities than the number of unknowns. &nbsp;This is illustrated below, where we consider a system of five inequalities in two unknowns.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The procedure for solving the system is exactly as before, namely solve each inequality separately and then determine which region is common to all solutions.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Solve the following system of inequalities graphically:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align} \PalAa{-x+y-3} &amp; \PalAa \leq \PalAa 0\\ \PalAb{x+y-5} &amp; \PalAb \leq \PalAb0 \\ \PalBc{x-3} &amp; \PalBc \leq \PalBc 0 \\ x &amp;\geq0\\ y&amp;\geq0 \end{align}\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We look at the last two of these inequalities first. &nbsp;The inequality <span class="math-tex">\(x\geq0\)</span> simply means the region to the right of and including the <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-axis whereas <span class="math-tex">\(y\geq0\)</span> means the region above and including the <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>-axis. &nbsp;Taken together, these two inequalities imply the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane so we can restrict our considerations to this region.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The <span class="PalAa">first inequality</span> is satisfied by all points on, below and to the right of the line</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align} \PalAa{-x+y-3} &amp; \PalAa = \PalAa0&amp; \text{or}\\ \PalAa{y} &amp; \PalAa = \PalAa{x+3} \end{align} \)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">That is the <span class="PalAa">blue</span> shaded region.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The <span class="PalAb">second inequality</span> is satisfied by all points on, below and to the left of the line</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align} \PalAb{x+y-5} &amp; \PalAb = \PalAb0&amp; \text{or}\\ \PalAb{y} &amp; \PalAb = \PalAb{-x+5} \end{align} \)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">That is the <span class="PalAb">red</span> shaded region.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Finally, the <span class="PalBc">third inequality</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align} \PalBc{x-3} &amp; \PalBc \leq \PalBc 0&amp; \text{or} \\ \PalBc{x} &amp; \PalBc \leq \PalBc 3 \end{align}\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">is satisfied by all points on and to the left of the vertical line <span class="math-tex">(PalBc{x=3})</span>. &nbsp;That is the <font color="#078446">yellow</font>&nbsp;shaded region.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The solution is the <span class="PalBa">overlap</span> region of all these inequalities, that is the <span class="PalBa">brown</span> shaded region&nbsp;shown in the graph below.</span></p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="450" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/227.html" width="450"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Note that the solution is called a closed or bounded&nbsp;solution because there are lines on&nbsp;all sides of the solution (i.e. the overlap region as indicated on the graph).</span></p>
