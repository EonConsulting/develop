    <h2>Non-price factors of supply</h2>
    <p>Non-price supply factors are all those factors, apart from the price of
      the good, that influence the supply of the good.</p>
    <p>These are factors such as the <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; price of inputs (cost of production)<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prices of alternative goods<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technology needed to make the good<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expected prices <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; number of suppliers<br>
      <br>
      Let us consider the impact of a change in the price of inputs (cost of
      production).</p>

      <h3>The price of inputs (cost of production)</h3>
      <p>Things like land, capital and labour are needed to make products.
        Businesses pay for these things (which are called the factors of
        production), and this payment forms part of the cost of production.<br>
        <br>
        For example, the labour used in producing something is paid for through
        wages, and wages are calculated as part of a business’s cost of
        production. A business will only be willing to supply a product to the
        market if it can cover its cost of production.<br>
        <br>
        The following are examples of the cost of production for fried chicken
        suppliers: <br>
        <br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the price of chickens bought from chicken farmers<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the price of the oil used for frying<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wages of employees<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of electricity used to run the ovens<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of rent for the building<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the interest the supplier pays on capital<br>
        •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the profit the supplier makes<br>
        <br>
        Any increases in the price of inputs will affect a business’s cost of
        production. For example, an increase in the wages that fried chicken
        suppliers pay for labour will increase the cost of producing fried chicken
        pieces. Fried chicken suppliers will therefore have to charge a higher
        price to supply the same quantity of fried chicken pieces to the market as
        they did before. <br>
      </p>

      <h3>The supply schedule and an increase in the cost of production </h3>
    <p>If the cost of production increases, it means that at each price, fried
      chicken suppliers will now supply a lower quantity than before. The supply
      of fried chicken pieces will therefore decrease.</p>
    <p>The relationship between the price of inputs and supply can be
      illustrated by using a supply schedule.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col s4">
            <p style="margin-top:45px;">Study the supply table to the right to see how an increase in the cost of
            production will affect the supply schedule for fried chicken pieces.</p>
          <p>Can you see how at each price, the supply of fried chicken pieces is
            lower?</p>
          <p>At a price of R7, the quantity supplied is 44 instead of 48 pieces; at a
            price of R6, the quantity supplied is 38 instead of 42 pieces; at a price
            of R5, the quantity supplied is 32 instead of 36 pieces; and so on.</p>
