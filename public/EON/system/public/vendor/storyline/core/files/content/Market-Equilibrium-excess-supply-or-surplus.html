<h2>EXCESS SUPPLY OR SURPLUS</h2>

<p>To explain how market equilibrium is reached, you have to understand what happens in the market if the price of a good is set at such a level that the plans of buyers and suppliers are different. This can occur when the price of a product is set at too high a level. When this happens, suppliers will supply a higher quantity of a product than buyers are prepared to buy. As a result, there will be excess supply or a surplus of the product on the market. In terms of fried chicken pieces, this means that the quantity of fried chicken pieces supplied is more that the quantity demanded.</p>

<p>In a surplus situation, even though buyers are still able to buy the quantity of a product they wish to purchase, suppliers become frustrated because they cannot sell the quantity that they plan to sell at the given price. To get rid of their surplus, some suppliers start to change their behaviour &ndash; by offering a lower price to buyers. Soon other suppliers follow, and the price of the good or service will decrease. The price of the good will continue to decrease until the market reaches equilibrium (where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied).</p>
