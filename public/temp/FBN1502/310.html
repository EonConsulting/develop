<h3 class="Heading2">An introduction to simple discount</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A <span class="PalAa">discount loan</span> is a loan on which the interest and financing charges are deducted from the face/future value when the loan is first taken out. &nbsp;The borrower only receives the discounted value after the financing charges and interest are subtracted, but must repay the full amount of the loan.</span></p>

		<p class="Definition">A discount loan is a short-term lending arrangement in which the<br />
