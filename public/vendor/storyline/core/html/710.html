    <h2>The price of inputs (cost of production)</h2>
    <p>Things like land, capital and labour are needed to make products.
      Businesses pay for these things (which are called the factors of
      production), and this payment forms part of the cost of production.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the labour used in producing something is paid for through
      wages, and wages are calculated as part of a business’s cost of
      production. A business will only be willing to supply a product to the
      market if it can cover its cost of production.<br>
      <br>
      The following are examples of the cost of production for fried chicken
      suppliers: <br>
      <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the price of chickens bought from chicken farmers<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the price of the oil used for frying<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wages of employees<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of electricity used to run the ovens<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of rent for the building<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the interest the supplier pays on capital<br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the profit the supplier makes<br>
      <br>
      Any increases in the price of inputs will affect a business’s cost of
      production. For example, an increase in the wages that fried chicken
      suppliers pay for labour will increase the cost of producing fried chicken
      pieces. Fried chicken suppliers will therefore have to charge a higher
      price to supply the same quantity of fried chicken pieces to the market as
      they did before.
