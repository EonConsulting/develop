<h3 class="Heading2">Projectile motion</h3>

<p>The appearances of parabolic shapes in the physical world are abundant.</p>

<p>Normally&nbsp;a thrown object, like a ball, will follow a parabolic path of motion as it leaves the hand of the thrower, flies and returns to earth. &nbsp;From basketballs to high jumpers to shot puts, nearly all objects travel through the air in the same kind of path. &nbsp;This&nbsp;path is called a parabolic curve or a <span class="Emphasis_1">parabola</span>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We can describe the position and speed of the&nbsp;objects&nbsp;at any point of the parabola, or at any point in time, using some simple equations.</p>

<p>All parabolas have a common shape. An example is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stream of water from a hose, or fountain, which&nbsp;starts&nbsp;upward, curves&nbsp;as it nears the peak,&nbsp;and straightens&nbsp;out somewhat as it heads back down. &nbsp;It is the same path followed by any thrown object, but it is easiest to see with water.</p>
