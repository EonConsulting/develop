<h3 class="Heading2">The slope of a parabola is not constant</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The slope of a quadratic function cannot be determined in only one calculation. &nbsp;Looking at graphs of parabola, we notice that&nbsp;a parabola has a slope at a point, but it is constantly changing as we&nbsp;move from point to point. &nbsp;This is unlike a straight line which has a constant slope.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">This is illustrated in the graph below with the use of <span class="Emphasis_1">tangents</span>. &nbsp;A tangent is a straight line that just touches the graph in one point, as illustrated. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The slope of a parabola at a specific point is actually the slope of the tangent to the parabola at that point. &nbsp;The slopes of the tangents vary at different points and hence the slope of a parabola is never the same at different points.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We will not calculate the slope of a parabola at different points. &nbsp;The main point to note is that the slope is ever-changing from point to point on the parabola, in contrast to the straight line where it is a constant.</span></p>
