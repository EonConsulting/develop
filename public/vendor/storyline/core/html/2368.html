        <h2>Factors that impact on price elasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Looking again at our table of price elasticity for various goods and services, we are now able
            to classify these according to relatively price inelastic and relatively price elastic. What we
            do not know yet is what causes different goods and services to have different price
            elasticities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why, for instance, is fuel relatively price inelastic, and restaurant meals relatively price
            elastic?
        </p>
        <h3>
            Availability of substitutes
        </h3>
        <p>Consider the following scenario:</p>
        <p>
            Peter lives 25 kilometres from his work and owns a small car powered by petrol, which he uses
            to travel to work. There is no public transport in the area in which he lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the price of petrol increases by 10% on Wednesday, will Peter be able to decrease his
            quantity of petrol by making use of a substitute?
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately for Peter, there is no substitute for petrol and he cannot make use of public
            transport because there is none where he lives. He will therefore not be able to decrease his
            quantity of petrol demanded by much. His demand for petrol is inelastic, owing to the
            absence of substitutes. This absence or non-availability of substitutes is therefore an important
            determinant of the price elasticity of petrol for Peter.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, bear in mind that the more substitutes there are, the more choices you have and
            the greater the price elasticity of the good or service will be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the example of a restaurant meal where there are a number of substitutes available
            such as a home-cooked meal, a take-away, and a pre-cooked meal from Shoprite or
            Woolworths. If the price of a restaurant meal increases, you can always switch to one of the
            substitutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you use more of a substitute, the quantity demanded of the other good decreases.
        </p>

                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>As a general rule, we can state the following:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">
            The more substitutes there are for a good or service, the more responsive or sensitive the
            quantity demanded will be to a change in the price. The price elasticity of quantity
            demanded is therefore higher and more elastic.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:50px;">
            The fewer substitutes there are, the less responsive or sensitive the quantity demanded for a
            change in price will be. The price elasticity of quantity demanded is therefore lower and
            demand is more price inelastic.
        </p>
        <h3>Proportion of income spent on goods or services</h3>
        <p>
            The last time I checked, a box of matches cost about 70 cents. If I buy four boxes of matches
            a month, my total spending on matches will be R2.80. An increase in the price of matches to
            77 cents, which is a 10% increase, would not make me change my behaviour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, a 10% decline in the price of matches would also not make me buy more matches.
            So my price elasticity for matches is relatively inelastic (it has a value of less than 1).
        </p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col s6">
                                <img src="../assets/91.svg">
                            </div>
                            <div class="col s6">

                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            The reason for this is not that there are no substitutes available (I could, for example, buy a
            lighter), but because the R2.80 is an insignificant proportion of my income. Whether I spend
            R2.80 or R3.08 per month on matches is not a big deal for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if it is about buying something like a new fridge, which costs about R4 500 and is a
            large proportion of my income, a 10% rise in the price of the fridge would make me
            reconsider buying it. Whether I spend R4 500 or R4 950 is important to me, and it is to be
            expected that my price elasticity for a fridge would be fairly elastic (has a value of more
            than 1).

            In general, we can state the following:
        </p>
        
        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
            The higher the proportion of income spent on a good and service, the more responsive or sensitive the quantity demanded will be to a change in the price. The price elasticity of quantity demanded is therefore higher and more elastic. The lower the proportion of income spent on a good or service, the less responsive or sensitive the quantity demanded will be to a change in price. The price elasticity of the quantity demanded is therefore lower and more
        </p>
          
        <p>
            But what about Peter’s spending on petrol?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Since he does spend a significant proportion of his income on petrol, should his
                demand for petrol then not be elastic?
            </li>
            <li>
                In the case of Peter, there are two forces impacting on his elasticity – the
                unavailability of substitutes and the proportion of income he spends on petrol.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The unavailability of substitutes makes it more inelastic, while the high proportion of his
            income that he spends on petrol makes it more elastic. In his case, the unavailability of
            substitutes is the stronger force.
        </p>
        <p>
            A consequence of this relationship between the proportion of income spent on a good or
            service, and the price elasticity of the good and service, is that different income groups have
            different price elasticities for the same good and service. For instance, the price elasticity of
            bread might be more elastic for a poor household than for a rich household, since poor
            households spend a larger proportion of their income on bread compared to rich
            households.
        </p>
        <p>
            One also finds that the price elasticity of cigarettes is different for teenagers and adults.

        <h3 style="margin-top: -26px;">Time period</h3>
        <p>
            In the short run, Peter has little choice about the amount of petrol he uses. He might cut
            down on some of his travelling – fewer trips to the shops and over weekends. In the long run,
            however, he has more choices. He could, for instance, replace his car with a more fuel-
            efficient car, join a lift club or move to an area closer to his work.
        </p>
        <p>As a general rule, we can state the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The longer the time period under consideration, the greater the price elasticity of a good
                or service will be.
            </li>
            <li>
                This short-run versus long-run elasticity has an important impact on the way prices are set
                in a market.
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style: circle">
                        Take, for example, the cost of an airline ticket from Johannesburg to Cape Town.
                        If you visit any of the following airline websites, <a target="_blank" href='http://www.flysaa.com/za/en/'>SAA</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flymango.com">Mango</a> or <a target="_blank" href='http://www.kulula.com'>Kulula</a>
                        , and you
                        compare the cost of a ticket next week with one in three months’ time, you will
                        probably find that purchasing an airline ticket three months in advance is
                        cheaper than purchasing it one week in advance.
                    </li>
                    <li style="list-style: circle">
                        The reason is that you have more time to look for substitutes, and manage and
                        change your travel and accommodation arrangements.

        </ul>
        <h3>Nature of the product</h3>
        <p>
            We can expect that goods that are necessary for our survival will tend to be relatively
            inelastic. These are things such as water, food, shelter and medical services. Luxuries,
            however, such as vacations, designer clothes and shoes, or champagne, will be relatively
            price elastic. Whether a good is regarded as a luxury or necessity depends on the taste and
            preference of the individual, and there is no exact rule to determine what goods can be
            classified as luxuries or necessities.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a general rule, we can state that if a good is regarded as a necessity, it will be relatively
            inelastic, whereas if it is regarded as a luxury good, it will tend to be elastic.
