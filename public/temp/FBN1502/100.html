<h3 class="Heading2">Examples of annuities</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The basic concepts of annuities are illustrated by the following examples. &nbsp;Notice how timelines, with the interest period as the unit, are used.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example 1</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The premium on an endowment policy is <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur 2 \Tsp 400 \Cdp 00\)</span> per year, payable for <span class="math-tex">\(20\)</span> years&nbsp;and payable at the end of each period.</span></p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="340" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/93.html" width="650"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Here the payment interval is one year and the term is <span class="math-tex">\(20\)</span> years. &nbsp;Since the payments are made at the end of each period, this is an <span class="Emphasis_1">ordinary annuity certain</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">This learning unit focuses on the ordinary annuity certain. &nbsp;When simply referring to an annuity,&nbsp;unless stated otherwise,&nbsp;it&nbsp;means an ordinary annuity certain.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example 2</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The monthly rent for a shop is <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur 1 \Tsp 000 \Cdp 00\)</span>&nbsp;payable in advance.</span></p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="340" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/94.html" width="650"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Here&nbsp;the payment interval is one month&nbsp;while the term will be determined by the contract. &nbsp;Since the payment is made at the beginning of each period, this is an <span class="Emphasis_1">annuity due</span>.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example 3</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">A company is expected to pay <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur 180 \Cdp 00\)</span>&nbsp;indefinitely&nbsp;every six months&nbsp;on a share of its preferred stock.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">This is an example of <span class="Emphasis_1">perpetuity</span> with payment interval of six months. In this case, no term is defined, since payments continue indefinitely.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="PalAa">In this learning unit we shall concentrate mainly on the ordinary annuity certain.<br />
From now on, we shall simply speak of &ldquo;an annuity&rdquo;, and, unless otherwise stated,<br />
will mean an ordinary annuity certain.</span></p>
