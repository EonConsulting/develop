<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">It is calculated by raising the percentage </span>change<span class="Bullet_List_2"> between the&nbsp;two quarters to the <span class="PalBc">power of</span> <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc4\)</span>.</span></li>
<li>The quarters are seasonally adjusted to remove all seasonal effects&nbsp;before its annualised.</li>
<li>It is assumed that the percentage change from the <span class="PalAa">one quarter</span>&nbsp;to the <span class="PalAb">following quarter</span> will be maintained for the entire year.</li>
<li>It is called <span class="Emphasis_1">annualising</span>&nbsp;and is used in South Africa as the official economic&nbsp;growth rate.</li>
<li><span class="BodyText">The advantage is that the quarterly growth rates can directly be compared with previous annual movements.</span></li>
<li><span class="BodyText">The disadvantage is that sometimes the annualised data can be very volatile due to the effects of any irregular&nbsp;</span><span class="BodyText">occurrences during a specific quarter, for example, labour disputes.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="BodyText">The formula used to calculate the percentage change between two quarters at an annualized rate is given below:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\text{(Q/Q) growth rate}= \left( \left( \displaystyle\frac{\PalAa{\text{GDP}}_{\PalAa{\text{current quarter}}}}{\PalAb{\text{GDP}}_{\PalAb{\text{previous quarter}}}}\right)^\PalBc4-1 \right) \times 100\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><span class="BodyText">Annualising</span> is to express the percentage change in the GDP between two consecutive quarters of a year in yearly terms, even though the percentage change does not directly apply to a year.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The percentage change in GDP between two consecutive quarters has been mathematically converted to yearly terms in an annualised number.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The annualised percentage change in the GDP is often theoretical because there is no guarantee that the percentage change in the GDP will be maintained between the remaining quarters of the entire year.</span></p>
