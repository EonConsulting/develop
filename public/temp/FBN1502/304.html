<h3 class="Heading2">Farmer</h3>

<p>A peanut farmer&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span class="PalAa">cost function</span>&nbsp;in rand, is given by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa {C(\PalAb x)=\displaystyle\frac{\PalAb x^2}{100}+100}\)</span><br />
where&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb x\)</span>&nbsp;represents the&nbsp;<span class="PalAb">number of kilograms</span>&nbsp;of peanuts produced. &nbsp;The cost is in rand.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<span class="PalCd">revenue function</span>&nbsp;is given by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\PalCd{R(\PalAb x)=31\PalAb x}\)</span>, that is&nbsp;each kilogram of peanuts produced is sold at&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\Cur31\Cdp00\)</span>.</p>

<p>The farmer&#39;s profit is the difference between income earned by selling (revenue) and the cost incurred for the production of the peanuts.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<span class="PalBc">profit function</span>&nbsp;is given by&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc{P(\PalAb x)=-\displaystyle\frac{\PalAb x^2}{100}+31\PalAb x-100}\)</span>, as illustrated in the graph below:</p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="400" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/268.html" width="650"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We can clearly see that the profit increases to a point where the profit is at a maximum, after which the profit decreases. &nbsp;The slope of the function is not constant and there is no constant rate of change.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The farmer can see where the <span class="PalBc">profit</span> will increase and where it will decrease, but he cannot see how the change in production level will influence the profit. &nbsp;What he wants to determine is the <span class="PalBa">marginal profit</span> at a specific <span class="PalAb">production</span> <span class="PalAb">level</span>.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">The <span class="PalBa">marginal profit</span> is the change in <span class="PalBc">profit</span> due<br />
		to a change in the number of <span class="PalAb">units produced</span>.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>This means that if the farmer produces <span class="math-tex">\({1\Tsp000}\)</span> kilograms and he is interested in knowing how the <span class="PalBc">profit</span> will change if one extra kilogram is produced, then he wants to determine the <span class="PalBa">marginal profit</span> at a <span class="PalAb">production level</span> of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb{1\Tsp000}\)</span><span class="BodyText">&nbsp;</span><span class="PalAb">kilograms</span>.</p>

<p>In order to know the change in profit at different production levels, the <span class="PalBa">slope</span> of the function at the different production levels must be determined.<br />
The method used in mathematics to determine this is called <span class="Emphasis_1">differentiation</span>.</p>

<p>The point of calculating marginal profit is that the costs and revenue of each unit are not always consistent. &nbsp;This can have a significant effect on marginal costs and revenue. &nbsp;The marginal calculations are thus based on the specific level of production a company is on at the time of calculation.</p>
