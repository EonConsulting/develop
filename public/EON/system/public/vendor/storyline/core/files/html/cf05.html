        <h2>Markets in the circular flow</h2>

 <p> <strong>Factor market</strong></p>
 
        <p>The factor market is the market in which the factors of production are bought and sold. It is through this market that 
households supply businesses with the factors of production, in exchange for an income in the form of wages and salaries, interest, 
rent and profits. Two active participants in this market are households, as the supplier of factors of production, and firms, 
as the demanders of the factors of production. The factor market includes the labour market as well as the market for capital.

    </div>
        

<p>The <strong>real flow</strong> is the flow of the factors of production – the quantity of labour, capital, land and entrepreneurship – from households to firms.</p> 
<p>The <strong>monetary flow</strong> is the flow of income in terms of money from firms to households – in other words, the amount that is paid in wages and salaries, 
interest, rent and profits. <p>Bear in mind that these flows are in opposite directions and they are related. 
Behind a real flow is a monetary and a change in a real flow changes the monetary flow, and vice versa. </p>

<p>&nbsp</p>
<p> <strong>Goods market</strong></p>

<p>There are literally thousands of different producers of goods and services and millions of different consumers of these goods and services in 
the economy. In macroeconomics, all these different markets for goods and services, which include both the producers and the consumers, are 
grouped together under the heading of the goods market. In economics, this grouping together is called aggregation.</p>

<p>It is in the goods market that households (consumers) buy their goods and services and the producers supply their goods and services. 
Two active participants in this market are households, as the demanders of goods and services, and firms, as the suppliers of goods and services.</p>

<p>The real flow is the <strong>flow of goods and services</strong> from firms to households. </p>
<p>The monetary flow is the <strong>flow of spending (payment) </strong> by households to firms for goods and services. </p>
<p>Note that households’ spending on goods 
and services becomes the revenue of firms. Firms then use this revenue to pay for the factors of production.  </p>
