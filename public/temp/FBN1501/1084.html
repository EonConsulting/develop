<h3 class="Heading2">Key definitions</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Radial is a company which advertises that its <em>XXX</em> tyres, generally known as <em>Triple X</em>, will complete at least <span class="math-tex">\(65\Tsp000\)</span> kilometres before one of the four tyres will no longer meet the minimum safety requirements. However, lately several complaints have been received that the tyres completed <span class="math-tex">\(50\Tsp000\)</span> kilometres only and thus the&nbsp;minimum requirements were not met.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Radial sells directly to the public and it is company policy to keep a record of customers. &nbsp;They have been manufacturing tyres for the past two&nbsp;years.&nbsp; In the&nbsp;previous six months they had sold <span class="math-tex">\(2\Tsp600\)</span>&nbsp;sets of <em>XXX</em> tyres. &nbsp;Radial feels that they do not have the time, personnel&nbsp;or money to locate and question all <span class="math-tex">\(2\Tsp600\)</span>&nbsp;of their customers. &nbsp;They feel that if they question <span class="math-tex">\(80\)</span>&nbsp;customers it should give them a good idea of what the actual situation is.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">In other words, they will take a <span class="PalAb">sample</span> of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb{80}\)</span>&nbsp;out of the <span class="PalAa">population</span> of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa{2\Tsp600}\)</span>. &nbsp;<br />
<span class="PalAb">Sample</span> and <span class="PalAa">population</span> are words which are inevitable when we wish to obtain data.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Consider the following definitions:</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">A <span class="PalAa">population</span> is the set of all the elements or items being studied.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">In Radial&#39;s case the set of all <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa{2\Tsp600}\)</span>&nbsp;sets of <em>XXX</em> tyres sold, is the <span class="PalAa">population</span>.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">A <span class="PalAb">sample</span> is a representative group or a subset of the population.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">The <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb{80}\)</span>&nbsp;sets of tyres that Radial will investigate will form the <span class="PalAb">sample</span>.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">A <span class="Emphasis_1">variable</span> is any property or characteristic<br />
		that can be measured or observed.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">A variable can take on a range of different values. &nbsp;For example, the distance completed with a set of tyres is different for each customer and therefore the observations vary continually. &nbsp;Distance completed is a variable.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">The <span class="Emphasis_1">sample unit</span> is the item which is measured or<br />
		counted with respect to the variable being studied.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">We see that the members of a sample are the sample units. &nbsp;Radial&#39;s sample unit is a set of tyres to be measured for the minimum safety requirements.</span></p>
