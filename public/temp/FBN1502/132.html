<h3 class="Heading2">What is a variable?</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">In mathematics&nbsp;variables are used within mathematical expressions&nbsp;and are most commonly denoted by a letter.</span></p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">In elementary mathematics a variable is a symbol<br />
		representing&nbsp;a number that is arbitrary or unknown.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><span class="BodyText">Variables are usually&nbsp;letters or other symbols that represent unknown numbers or values.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Any letter you can think of can be used as a variable. It can be uppercase or lowercase. When you get into more complex mathematical&nbsp;applications, you might use several variables at a time.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Normally we use a letter that reminds us of the item we are discussing in the problem. So if it is the number of cars, we may use either <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;for number or <span class="math-tex">\(c\)</span> for cars.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Let the number of people employed by a firm be&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>. &nbsp;So, the number of people employed by the firm&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(=n\)</span>.</span></p>
