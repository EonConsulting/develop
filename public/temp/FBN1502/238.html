<h3 class="Heading2">Examples</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The best thing about exponential functions is that they are so useful in real world situations. &nbsp;For example, exponential functions are used to model compound interest, radioactive decay and various types of growth (populations, bacterial or animal). &nbsp;This explains the expression <span class="Emphasis_1">exponential growth</span>.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example of&nbsp;compound interest</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">An initial investment of <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur1\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> with a <span class="math-tex">\(5\%\)</span> annual interest rate&nbsp;compounded annually will grow according to the formula</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align}S(n)&amp;=P(1+i)^n\\ &amp;=1\Tsp000(1+0\Ndp05)^n\end{align}\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">where <span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> is the number of years the money has been invested. &nbsp;Such an investment will double roughly every <span class="math-tex">\(14\)</span> years.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Example of population growth</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">The population of a town in 2013 was estimated to be <span class="math-tex">\(35\Tsp000\)</span> people with an annual growth rate of about <span class="math-tex">\(2\Ndp4\%\)</span>. &nbsp;The population will grow according to the formula</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(y=35\Tsp000(1\Ndp024)^x\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">where <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span> is the size of the population in 2013 and <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span> is the number of years since 2013.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Using this equation to estimate the population in 2017 to the nearest hundred people, will give</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align}y&amp;=35\Tsp000(1\Ndp024)^4\\&amp;\approx38\Tsp500\end{align}\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The estimated population in 2017 is <span class="math-tex">\(38\Tsp500\)</span> people.</span></p>
