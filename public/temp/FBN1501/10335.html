<h3 class="Heading2">Variability of data sets</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">It is often difficult to use the standard deviation formula to compare measurements from different populations. &nbsp;Due to this fact, statisticians produced the <span class="Emphasis_1">coefficient of variation</span> <span class="math-tex">\((CV)\)</span>. &nbsp;The coefficient of variation expresses the standard deviation as a percentage of what is being measured relative to the sample or population mean.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The coefficient of variation is useful because the standard deviation of data must always be understood in the context of the mean of the data. &nbsp;In contrast, the actual value of the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> is independent of the unit in which the measurement has been taken, so it is a dimensionless number.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The numerator and denominator of the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> have the same units, so the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> itself has no units of measurement. &nbsp;If a data set consists of the monthly salaries of employees, the mean salary will be in rand and the standard deviation will also be in rand, but the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span>&nbsp;will not be.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">What we mean when we say that&nbsp;the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> has no units of measurement,&nbsp;is that when the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> is calculated, the units cancel out. &nbsp;This can be illustrated as follows, using rand <span class="math-tex">\((\Cur)\)</span>&nbsp;as unit of measurement:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(CV=\displaystyle\frac{S}{\overline{x}}=\frac{\not\Cur}{\not\Cur}\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> is sometimes expressed as a percentage, in which case the <span class="math-tex">\(CV\)</span> is multiplied by <span class="math-tex">\(100\)</span>:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(CV=\displaystyle\frac{S}{\overline{x}}\times 100=\%\)</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The advantage is that one is able to directly compare the variability of two different populations using the coefficient of variation.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">For comparison between data sets with different units or widely different means, one should use the coefficient of variation instead of the standard deviation.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We can also use the coefficient of variation if we wish to compare the variability of two or more data sets.</span></p>
