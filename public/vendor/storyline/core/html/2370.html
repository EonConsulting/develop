        <h2>Firms' total revenue and price elasticity</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, we take a closer look at what happens to the total revenue of firms if the prices
            change.
        </p>
        <p>
            While households are concerned about what happens to their total spending if prices change,
            firms are concerned about what happens to their total revenue if prices change. Firms would
            typically want to understand what will happen to their total revenue if the price of the good or
            service they supply changes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Will a price increase cause their total revenue to increase or decrease?</li>
            <li>Will a price decrease cause their total revenue to increase or decrease?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To answer these questions, you need to understand the relationship between price elasticity and
            total revenue.

        <h3 style="margin-top:-55px;">Link between total spending and total revenue</h3>
        <p>
            The total revenue of firms and the total spending by households are directly related. As total
            spending by households changes, the total revenue of firms will change. When households
            spend more, firms sell more, and their total revenue thus increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if households decrease their total spending, firms will sell less and their total revenue
            will decline.
        </p>
        <p>
            As explained earlier, total spending by households is equal to the
            price they pay for a good or service times the quantity bought of the good or service:
        </p>
        <p>
            TS = P x Q
        </p>
        <p>
            The total revenue of firms is equal to the price paid for the good or service times the quantity
            sold to households:
        </p>
        <p>
            TR = P x Q
        </p>
        <p>In other words: <strong>TS = P x Q = TR</strong></p>
        <p>Total spending and total revenue are two sides of the same coin.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For example, if the total spending of households on restaurant meals is R100 000, then
                the total revenue firms receive by supplying the restaurant meals is also R100 000.
            </li>
            <li>
                If households increase their spending on restaurant meals by say, R10 000, then the
                total revenue of firms supplying restaurant meals also increases by R10 000.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Total revenue and inelastic demand</h3>
        <p>
            In the section on household spending and price elasticity, we argued that if demand is price
            inelastic, an increase in price will increase total spending by households, while a decrease in
            price will decrease total spending by households.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What does this imply for the total revenue of firms?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="self-assessment-intro">
            Do the following activity to see what happens to the total revenue of a firm if demand is inelastic
            and the price increases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that the total revenue of firms is directly related to households total spending. If you
            are unsure about what happens to total spending if demand is inelastic, quickly revise it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our activity, we established that if demand is inelastic, then an increase in price will lead to an
            increase in total revenue. This is represented in the following diagram:
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class='col s12'>
                <img src="../assets/111.svg" class="centered-graph">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:0;">
            An increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes from R30 to R33 decreases the quantity
            demanded from 10 000 to 9 500. This has the impact that total revenue increases from R300 000
            (blue rectangle) to R313 500 (orange rectangle).
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class='col s12'>
                <img src="../assets/113.svg" class="centered-graph">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:0;">
            In terms of gains and losses, the seller loses revenue of 500 x R30 = R15 000 (blue rectangle) and
            gains 9 500 x R3 = R28 500 (orange rectangle). The total gain in revenue is R28 500 – R15 000 =
            R13 500.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, we can conclude that if demand is inelastic, an increase in price will increase total
            revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what happens to total revenue if the price decreases? In the case where demand is inelastic, a decrease in price will decrease total revenue, as demonstrated in the following example:

        <p>
            In conclusion, we can therefore state the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Since goods and services, such as salt and petrol and medical services, are price inelastic,
                the quantity demanded by households is not that responsive to a change in price.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the price of the good or service changes, the change in quantity demanded by
                households is relatively small compared to the change in price.
            </li>
            <li>
                The consequence of this for total spending by households is that in the event of a rise in the
                price of the good or service, the total spending by households on the good or service
                increases.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Since the total spending by households is the total revenue of firms, the total revenue of firms
            increases as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if the price of a price inelastic good or service falls, total spending by households
            declines, and the total revenue of firms therefore declines as well.

                The total gain in revenue is R22 500 – R15 000 = R12 500.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, we can therefore state the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Since a good or service, such as a pair of shoes or a movie is price elastic, the quantity
                demanded by households is highly responsive to a change in price.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the price of the good or service changes, the change in quantity demanded by
                households is relatively large compared to the change in price. The consequence of this
                for total spending by households, and the total revenue of firms, is that in the event of a
                rise in the price of the good or service, the total spending by households on the good or
                service decreases.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the total spending by households is the total revenue of firms, the total revenue of
                firms declines as well.
            </li>
            <li>
                However, if the price of a price elastic good or service falls, total spending by households
                declines, and the total revenue of firms therefore declines as well.
