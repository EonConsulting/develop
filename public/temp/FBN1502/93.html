<h3 class="Heading2">Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="Emphasis_1">Amortisation</span> is the process of gradually reducing a debt through instalment payments of principal&nbsp;<span class="Bullet_List_2">and&nbsp;interest.</span></span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The loan is said to be <span class="Emphasis_1">amortised</span> when all liabilities, that is both the principal (the amount of&nbsp;the loan)&nbsp;and interest, are paid by a sequence of equal payments made at equal intervals of time.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The size of the <span class="Emphasis_1">payments</span> is calculated by using the formula for the present value of an annuity.<br />
<span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span>&nbsp;is known and <span class="math-tex">\(R\)</span> must be calculated:</span></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(R=P\times\left[ \displaystyle\frac{i(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1} \right]\)</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The <span class="Emphasis_1">amortisation schedule</span> is a table indicating the distribution of each payment in regard to&nbsp;interest&nbsp;and principal reduction. &nbsp;<span class="BodyText">The table has five columns:</span></span><br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Style_Steps" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row" style="width: 20%;"><span class="BodyText">Column 1</span></th>
		<td><span class="BodyText">Payment interval</span></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row"><span class="BodyText">Column 2</span></th>
		<td><span class="BodyText">Outstanding principal at beginning of payment interval</span></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th scope="row"><span class="BodyText">Column 3</span></th>
		<td><span class="BodyText">Simple interest due at end of payment interval</span></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

</table>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="Emphasis_1">Interest rates</span> change from time to time. &nbsp;If the interest rate changes, the payments change accordingly. &nbsp;After the change in interest rate, the present value is recalculated for&nbsp;the&nbsp;remaining period of time. &nbsp;The size of the payments is also recalculated according to the new&nbsp;interest rate.</span></li>
