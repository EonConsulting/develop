<h3 class="Heading2">Compound interest amount</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Suppose Paul invests <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur600\Cdp00\)</span> for three years at a <span class="PalAa"><span class="PalAa">compounded interest</span></span> rate of <span class="math-tex">\(10\%\)</span> per annum.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">We can see that for <span class="PalAa">compounded interest</span> the interest amount <span class="PalAa">increases </span>every year; it is <span class="PalAa"><span class="Emphasis_1">different</span></span> every year.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText"><span class="PalAa">Compounded interest</span> can be applied in both the following situations:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="PalAa"><span class="Bullet_List_2">Make one investment and leave it to gain an increased amount of interest per year.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="PalAa"><span class="Bullet_List_2">Borrow one amount of money which accumulates an increased amount of interest per year.</span></span></li>
</ul>
