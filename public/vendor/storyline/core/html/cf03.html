        <h2>Link between production and income</h2>

 <div style="text-align: center;"><img title="Image title" alt="three flows" src="cf02.GIF" style="max-width:450px;"><br></div>

        <p> The reason we produce goods and services is to satisfy our needs and wants. To produce these goods and services, factors of production are needed. </p>
<p> In a market system, the factors of production belong to households, who are then paid an income by producers for the use of the factors of production. 
As production takes place, a flow of income is created. If you are working (employed), the contribution of your effort is part of the production flow, 
while the payment you receive is part of the flow of income. </p>


 <h2>Link between income and spending</h2>


<div style="text-align: center;"><img title="Image title" alt="three flows" src="cf03.GIF" style="max-width:450px;"><br></div>
<p> We have now established that as production takes place, a flow of income is created. This income, which flows to households from firms, is then spent 
by the households on the goods and services that were produced, and as they spend, a flow of spending or expenditure is created. As you spend the income 
you received from taking part in the process of production, you are creating a spending flow.

 <h2>Link between spending and production</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img title="Image title" alt="three flows" src="cf04.GIF" style="max-width:450px;"><br></div>

<p> The expenditure in the economy is linked to production. When we bake bread we are taking part in production, when we are paid for baking the bread, 
we are part of the income flow, and when we spend our income on buying the bread, we are part of the expenditure flow.</p>
<p>Let’s use an example to explain these flows and the interdependencies. </p>
<p> James is a family man and works at the local bakery as a bread baker. To illustrate the circular flow between production, 
income and expenditure we are going to use part of James’s life story.</p>


<div style="text-align: center;"><img title="Image title" alt="three flows" src="cf05.GIF" style="max-width:550px;"><br></div>

<p> As James works as a baker and bakes bread, he is part of the production process. At the end of every month James receives a salary from the 
bakery for his bread making. The salary James receives is income for him and his family. James’s wife Martha does the groceries for the household 
at the end of every month; she buys everything the family needs, including the bread James helped bake. James’s family is now part of the spending 
or expenditure process. That will happen all the time as long as James works and spends his income.</p>

<p>There is a continuous circular flow between production, income and spending in the economy.  A change in production, such as an increase in production, 
will lead to an increase in income, which, in turn, will result in an increase in spending.</p>
