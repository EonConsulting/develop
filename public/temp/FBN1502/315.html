<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="PalAa">Money is not free to borrow</span><span class="PalAa">. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText">People can always find a use for money,&nbsp;so it costs money to borrow money.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="PalAa">How much does it cost to borrow money?</span> &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Different places charge different amounts at different times, but they usually charge it as a percentage <span class="math-tex">\((\%)\)</span>&nbsp;per year of the amount borrowed.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width:100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>

		<p class="Definition">Interest is the price paid for the use of borrowed money.</p>

	</tr>
</tbody>

<p style="text-align: center;">Think of interest as the rent you have to pay for using someone else&#39;s money.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Did you know that there is a cost of money even if you are using all of your own money? How? Since you are using your own money instead of putting it into a savings account, you are foregoing the <span class="math-tex">\(8\%\)</span> interest you could make on it.<br />
Thus, the cost of money in this case is actually <span class="math-tex">\(8\%\)</span>!</p>
