        <h2>Factors that influence supply</h2>
        <p>
            All businesses that supply goods and services have to make a number of difficult 
            decisions about the kinds, amounts and prices of the goods and services they wish to supply.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a market system, businesses only supply goods and services that can make a profit. 
            Likewise, a business will not supply a good or service that cannot make a profit. 
            Even if there is a demand for a good or service, it will only be supplied if a profit can be made.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consequently, the government or other non-profit enterprises usually supply goods and services 
            that private firms regard as unprofitable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Economists agree that the following factors are the main determinants of the supply of a good or service: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the price of a good or service (represented by the symbol P<sub>x</sub>)</li>
            <li>the prices of inputs, also known as the cost of production (represented by the symbol P<sub>c</sub>)</li>
            <li>the prices of alternative goods and services (represented by the symbol P<sub>g</sub>)</li>
            <li>the technology needed to make the good (represented by the symbol T)</li>
            <li>the number of suppliers (represented by the symbol N)</li>
            <li>the weather</li>
            <li>expected prices</li>	
        </ul>
        <p>
            Apart from the price of the good or service and the number of suppliers, all the other factors are mainly 
            concerned with the cost of production. A firm’s supply decision therefore mainly depends on the cost of production 
            and the profits that it can make by supplying the good or service.
