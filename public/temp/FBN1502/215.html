<p><span class="BodyText">In these two pictures&nbsp;several things are different. &nbsp;Note the following differences:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">In the grid we have put arrows at the end of all the lines. &nbsp;This simply means that the grid goes on forever in all directions.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The compass directions (north, south, east and west) in the map are replaced with positive and negative numbers in the grid. &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">East and north are positive, while west and south are negative.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="PalAa">Middle Street</span> on the map is now&nbsp;</span><span class="BodyText">the&nbsp;</span><span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa y\)</span><span class="BodyText"><span class="PalAa">-axis</span> in the grid.</span><span class="Bullet_List_2"> The Cartesian plane has only one vertical axis, known as the <span class="math-tex">\(y\)</span>-axis.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2"><span class="PalAb">Main Road</span> on the map is now the&nbsp;</span><span class="BodyText">&nbsp;</span><span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb x\)</span><span class="BodyText"><span class="PalAb">-axis</span> in the grid. &nbsp;</span><span class="Bullet_List_2">The Cartesian plane has only one horizontal axis,&nbsp;known as the <span class="math-tex">\(x\)</span>-axis.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">The Town Hall at the centre of town on the map is replaced by the&nbsp;word origin. (You need not write the word&nbsp;in when using the Cartesian plane.) It shows us that the middle point&nbsp;has a special name. This is the place you start from when finding your way through the Cartesian plane. The origin is often labelled <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>.</span></li>
