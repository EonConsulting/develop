<h3 class="Heading2">In general</h3>

<p>Regarding <span class="PalAa">exponents</span>, any number raised to the <span class="PalAa">power of one</span>, is equal to <span class="PalAa">the number</span> and any number raised to the <span class="PalAb">power of zero</span>, is equal to <span class="PalAb">one</span>.</p>

<p>Therefore, for <span class="PalAb">logarithms</span> there are two general results in particular:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="Table_Definition" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<p class="Definition">Because&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a\PalAa{^1}=\PalAa a\)</span>, it follows that&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\log_a\PalAb a=\PalAb1\)</span>,<br />
		and<br />
		because&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a^\PalAa0=\PalAa1\)</span>, it follows that <span class="math-tex">\(\log_a\PalAb1=\PalAb0\)</span>.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Note that the base in the two cases above is equal to <span class="math-tex">\(a\)</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">When the base is <span class="math-tex">\(10\)</span> you get the <span class="Emphasis_1">common logarithm</span>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\log_{10}y\)</span>, which is sometimes just written as <span class="math-tex">\(\log y\)</span>.</span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">When the base is <span class="math-tex">\(e\)</span>, you get the <span class="Emphasis_1">natural logarithm</span>. &nbsp;The calculator has a key for&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\log_e\)</span> which is usually&nbsp;<span class="Bullet_List_2">denoted by the symbol <span class="math-tex">\(ln\)</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="Bullet_List_2">(The symbol <span class="math-tex">\(e\)</span> is a famous number in mathematics. &nbsp;It is called Euler&#39;s number and approximates to <span class="math-tex">\(2\Ndp718\)</span>.)</span></span></span></li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">In computer science we have <span class="math-tex">\(lg\)</span> which is the logarithm base <span class="math-tex">\(2\)</span>, or <span class="math-tex">\(\log_2\)</span>.</span></li>
