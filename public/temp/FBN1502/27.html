<h3 class="Heading2">Drawing the graph on a set of axes with two points</h3>

<p>Only two points are needed to determine an equation of a straight line and to draw the graph of a straight line.</p>

<p>If you are not convinced of this, just mark two points on a piece of paper and try to put more than one straight line through them.</p>

<p>To draw a straight line we make use of the general method.</p>
