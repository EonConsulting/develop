<p>Firms use the factors of production to produce goods and services that they make available to households through the goods market. This is 
the real flow of goods and services from firms to households, and it is indicated by the <a graph="graph1" src="cf16.svg">green dotted line</a>. An example of this flow 
would be the actual groceries you buy from, say, your local supermarket. </p>

<p> Households use their income to pay for the goods and services they receive from firms. This payment for goods and services is a monetary 
flow from the households to firms through the goods market (indicated by the <a graph="graph1" src="cf17.svg">orange solid line</a>, and it is the spending flow. An example 
of this flow would be when you pay for your groceries. </p> 

<p>We can therefore distinguish between two kinds of flows between households and firms, namely real flows and monetary flows through the factor 
market and the goods market. Notice how the <a graph="graph1" src="cf04.svg">monetary flow</a> is in the opposite direction of the <a graph="graph1" src="cf05.svg">real flow</a>. </p>
