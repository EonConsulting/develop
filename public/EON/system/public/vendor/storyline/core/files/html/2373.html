            As shown above, for the Dlamini family, chicken burgers are a substitute for fried chicken. 
            What do you think will happen to the Dlamini's demand for fried chicken pieces if chicken burgers are suddenly sold at a much lower price?
        </p>
        <p>
            If the price of chicken burgers suddenly decreases, the Dlamini family will probably plan to eat more chicken burgers and fewer fried chicken 
            pieces per week. Their demand for fried chicken pieces will therefore be lower. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, if the price of a substitute good (chicken burgers) decreases, the demand for the other good (fried chicken pieces) 
            usually decreases. In this case, the demand for fried chicken pieces decreases and the demand curve shifts to the left.

            In diagram A, the demand curve for chicken burgers is given, and in diagram B, the demand curve for fried chicken pieces.<br/><br/>
            Assume that the price of chicken burgers decreases. How will this impact on the demand for chicken burgers and the demand for 
            fried chicken pieces?  Looking at the demand for chicken burgers (diagram a), the decrease in the <a graph="graph1" src="../assets/1067.svg">price</a> increases the <a graph="graph1" src="../assets/1068.svg">quantity demanded</a>.
            There is a <a graph="graph1" src="../assets/1069.svg">downward movement</a> along the demand curve for chicken burgers.<br/><br/>
            As households switch their consumption from fried chicken pieces to chicken burgers, the demand for fried chicken pieces decreases. The <a graph="graph2" src="../assets/1064.svg">demand curve</a> 
            for fried chicken pieces <a graph="graph2" src="../assets/1065.svg">shifts to the left</a>, indicating that at each price, the <a graph="graph2" src="../assets/1066.svg">quantity</a> of fried chicken pieces is lower.<br/><br/>

            In other words, if the price of a substitute good (chicken burgers) decreases, the demand for the other good (fried chicken pieces) usually decreases. In this example, 
            the demand for fried chicken pieces decreases and the demand curve shifts to the left.
