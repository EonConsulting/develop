        <h2>A decrease in demand and a decrease in supply</h2>
        <p>
            We know from our previous analysis that a decrease in demand and a decrease in supply 
            will both decrease the quantity. A simultaneous decrease in both demand and supply will 
            therefore decrease the quantity, as demonstrated in the next diagram.  As D decreases 
            to D<sub>1</sub> and S decreases to S<sub>1</sub>, 
            the equilibrium quantity declines from Q<sub>e</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub>.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            However, what we cannot predict is what happens to the price. In the above diagram, the price is unchanged 
            since the relative shift of the demand and supply curve is the same. They shifted by the same magnitude. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next two diagrams, the price either increases or decreases, depending on the relative 
            shifts of the demand and supply curves.

                <p style="margin-top:0;">A decrease in demand and an increase in supply decreases quantity and increases price</p>

        <p style="margin-top:0;">
            In figure on the left, the price increases from P<sub>e</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>. This is because the relative shift of the 
            supply curve was greater than that of the demand curve. The impact of a decrease in the supply, 
            which increases the price, is greater than the impact of a decrease in demand, which decreases the price. 
            The net effect is an increase in the price. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, in figure on the right, the price decreases from P<sub>e</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>. This is because the relative shift 
            of the demand curve is now greater than that of the supply curve. The impact of a decrease in the demand, 
            which decreases the price, is greater than the impact of a decrease in supply, which increases the price, 
            and the net effect is a decrease in the price.
