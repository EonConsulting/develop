<h3 class="Heading2">Boundary line</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Using the Cartesian plane is especially helpful for understanding the range of possible solutions for inequalities with two variables. &nbsp;When a linear inequality with two variables is graphed in the Cartesian plane, the full range of possible solutions is represented as a shaded area in the plane.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The boundary line for the inequality is drawn as a <span class="PalAa">solid line</span> if the points on the line itself <span class="PalAa">do satisfy</span> the inequality, as in the cases of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa \leq\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa \geq\)</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The boundary line for the inequality is drawn as a <span class="PalAb">dashed line</span> if the points on the line <span class="PalAb">do not satisfy</span> the inequality, as in the cases of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb&lt;\)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb&gt;\)</span>.</span></p>
