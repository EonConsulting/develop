<p><span class="BodyText">Making sense of the importance of the shaded region in an inequality is difficult without assigning any context to it. &nbsp;The following example&nbsp;shows one instance where the shaded region helps us understand a range of possibilities.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Cecile and Julia want to donate some money to a local cr&egrave;che. &nbsp;To raise funds, they are selling necklaces and earrings that they have made themselves. &nbsp;<span class="PalAa">Necklaces</span> cost <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur80\Cdp00\)</span> and a <span class="PalAb">pair of earrings</span> cost <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Cdp00\)</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">What is the range of possible sales they could make in order to donate a minimum of <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur1\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span>?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The range of possible sales&nbsp;is&nbsp;given by the inequality</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(80\PalAa x+50\PalAb y\geq1\Tsp000\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">which can also be written as</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb y\geq-\displaystyle\frac{8}{5}\PalAa x+20\)</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The variable <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa x\)</span> represents the number of <span class="PalAa">necklaces</span> sold and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb y\)</span> the number of <span class="PalAb">pairs of earrings</span> sold.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The correct graph that represents this inequality is</span></p>

<p class="Image"><iframe frameborder="0" height="450" scrolling="no" src="/FBN1502/assets/262.html" width="450"></iframe></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The shaded region represents all the possible combinations of necklaces and earrings that Cecile and Julia could sell in order to make at least <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur1\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> for the cr&egrave;che. &nbsp;It is quite a wide range.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Note that while all points will satisfy the inequality, not all points will make sense in this context. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Take for example the point <span class="math-tex">\((\PalAa{6\Ndp5};\PalAb{15\Ndp75})\)</span>. &nbsp;It satisfies the inequality because</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align} \PalAb y&amp;\geq-\displaystyle\frac{8}{5}\PalAa x+20\\ \PalAb{15\Ndp75}&amp;\geq-\displaystyle\frac{8}{5} \times \displaystyle\frac{\PalAa{6\Ndp5}}{1}+20\\15\Ndp75&amp;\geq 9\Ndp6 \end{align} \)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">is true. &nbsp;But while this point does fall within the shaded region, it is hard to expect them to sell <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa{6\Ndp5}\)</span> <span class="PalAa">necklaces</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb{15\Ndp75}\)</span> <span class="PalAb">pairs of earrings</span>. &nbsp;How could&nbsp;they sell half a necklace?</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The women can look for whole number combinations in the shaded region to plan how much jewellery to produce.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The point <span class="math-tex">\((\PalAa{8};\PalAb{15})\)</span> also falls within the shaded region. &nbsp;If they sell <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa{8}\)</span> <span class="PalAa">necklaces</span> and <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb{15}\)</span> <span class="PalAb">pairs of earrings</span>, their sales are&nbsp;calculated as</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="BodyText"><span class="math-tex">\(\begin{align}80\PalAa x+50\PalAb y&amp;=80 \times \PalAa 8+50 \times \PalAb {15}\\ &amp;=1\Tsp390 \end{align}\)</span></span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">Their sales will be <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur1\Tsp390\Cdp00\)</span> which is indeed greater than or equal to <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur1\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span>.</span></p>
