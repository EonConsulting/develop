        <h2>Total spending and price elastic demand</h2>
        <p>
            We know now that if the demand for a product is price inelastic, an increase in the price will
            increase total spending, while a decrease in price will decrease total spending.
        </p>
        <p>
            Does this also apply to a price elastic demand?
        </p>
        <p>
            If demand is price elastic, it has a price elasticity of more than 1. For price elastic demand, the
            percentage change in price is smaller than the percentage change in quantity demanded,
            which indicates that the quantity demand is relatively sensitive or responsive to the price.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use the demand for restaurant meals, which has a price elasticity of 2,5, as an example
            to see what happens to total spending if the price changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            At R100 a restaurant meal, the total spending by households is P x Q = R100 x 1 000 = R100 000.

        <p>
            This information is entered in the following table in the first row:

                <td>1,000</td>

            <tr>
                <td>
                    Monthly spending at R110 per meal
                </td>
                <td>R110</td>
                <td>750</td>
                <td>82,500</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>
            A 10% increase in the price of a restaurant meal increases the price to R110. Given a price
            elasticity of 2,5, it means that a 10% rise in the price will decrease the quantity demanded by
            25% (10% x 2,5 = 25%). The quantity demanded therefore decreases by 25% x 1 000 = 250. At
            R110, the quantity demanded is therefore 1000 – 250 = 750 restaurant meals.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The total spending at R110 per meal is 750 x R110 = R82 500.</li>
            <li>
                Because the price of restaurant meals increased by 10%, their total spending
                declined from R100 000 to R82 500.
            </li>
            <li>
                This information is entered in the second row of the table above.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            What we can conclude from this is that in the case of a price elastic demand, an increase in
            price will cause a decrease in total spending of the good or service. The reason for this is that
            the percentage increase in price is smaller than the percentage decrease in quantity
            demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
            The above can be represented as a chain of events as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="">
            If <i>e<sub>p</sub></i> > 1: &uarr; P &rarr; &darr; TS
        </p>
        <p>
            If price elasticity is greater than 1, then an increase in the price will result in a decrease in total
            spending.
        </p>
        <h3>Using diagrams to illustrate household spending and elasticity</h3>
        <p>
            We will use the same example of the demand for restaurant meals to illustrate what happens
            with total spending if the price of a good or service with an elastic demand changes.
            Remember, in this section we are studying the effect of an increase in price.
        </p>
        <p>
            The price elasticity of restaurant meals is 2,5, and at a price of R100 a meal, households buy 1 000 
            meals per month.
        </p>
        <p>
            What will happen to the total spending by households on restaurant meals if the price of a
            restaurant meal increases by 10%?
        </p>
        <p>
            In the section below, we show graphically what happens to total spending if the price of
            restaurant meals increases by 10%.
        </p>
        <p>
            The calculations we use are the same as those in our previous example [55] and they are
            summarised in the following table:
        </p>
        <p class="table-title">
            Table 4 Total spending on restaurant meals
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td><strong>P</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Q<sub>d</sub></strong></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>

                </td>
                <td>R100</td>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p class="video-intro">
            Watch the video clip below on the impact of an increase in the price on total spending if demand is inelastic.
        </p>
        <div class="video-holder">
            <img src="http://placehold.it/560x315?text=video-placeholder" alt="insert video [UECA-130]"><br />
        </div>
        <p>
            In the above explanation, we compared household’s spending before and after the increase in
            price, and then reached the conclusion that if demand is elastic, an increase in price decreases
            total spending.
        </p>
        <h3>Gains and losses</h3>
        <p>Another way of looking at it is to compare the gains with the losses.</p>
        <p>The argument is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the price increases from R100 to R110, households consume 250 fewer restaurant meals.</li>
            <li>
                At a price of R110, they spend 250 x R100 = R25 000 less on restaurant meals. This is indicated
                in the following diagram as <span style="color: #09436b" >the blue rectangle</span>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="row" style="margin-bottom:0; text-align:center;">
            <div class="col s12">
                <img src="../assets/131.svg" class="centered-graph">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:0;">However, they now pay R110 per restaurant meal – that is R10 more per meal.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How much more are households now spending on restaurant meals in total?
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style: circle">
                        Well, they now consume 750 meals and pay R10 more, so their increase in
                        spending is 750 x R10 = R7 500. This is indicated by <span style="color: #e7682a;">the orange rectangle</span>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Their decrease in spending is therefore R25 000 – R7 500 = R17 500 (difference
                between the blue and orange rectangles).
            </li>
            <li>
                The orange rectangle is smaller than the blue rectangle, which indicates that what
                households save by consuming fewer restaurant meals is greater than their increased
                spending due to the higher price.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once again, we can draw the conclusion that if demand is elastic, then an increase in the price
            will lead to a decrease in total spending by households.
        </p>
        <h3>Decrease in the price</h3>
        <p>
            We have established that if demand is elastic, such as the demand for restaurant meals, an
            increase in the price will decrease total spending.
        </p>
        <p>
            What happens if the price decreases?

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Returning to our original questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Does an increase in the price cause households to increase or decrease their total
                spending on the good or service?
            </li>
            <li>
                Does a decrease in the price cause households to increase or decrease their total
                spending on the good or service?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            What we can say now is that if the price elasticity of a good or service is elastic (greater than 1),
            an increase in price will decrease total spending, while a decrease in price will increase total
            spending.

        <p>
            Returning to our original question, we can now answer it:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Does an increase in the price cause households to increase or decrease their total

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The answer is that it depends on the price elasticity.
