        <h2>Household spending and price elasticity</h2>
        <p>
            One of the reasons we study the demand for a good or service is to help us understand the
            determinants of spending by households. How much households spend on a good or service
            and, in particular, what happens to their spending if the price changes, are important issues that
            we need to investigate further.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the law of demand, we know that if the price of a good or service decreases, people will
            demand a higher quantity of it, and if the price increases, they will demand a lower quantity of
            it. But what happens to their total spending if the price changes?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Does an increase in the price of a good or service cause households to increase or
                decrease their total spending on the good or service?
            </li>
            <li>
                Does a decrease in the price of a good or service cause households to increase or
                decrease their total spending on the good or service?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top: -50px;">Total spending and price inelastic demand</h3>
        <p>
            Total spending by households on a good or service is equal to the price (P) they paid for the
            good or service times the quantity (Q) they bought. In symbols, this is written as: 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Total spending = <i>P</i> × Q</strong></p>
        <p>
            What we want to know is what happens to total spending if the price changes. Remember that
            as the price changes, so does the quantity demanded – both P and Q change. It is the price
            elasticity that will tell us by how much the quantity demanded changes, and thus what happens
            to total spending.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have identified two main types of price elasticity, namely inelastic and elastic. Now, let’s see
            what happens to total spending if we have a price inelastic demand.
        </p>
        <h3>Increase in price</h3>
        <p>
            A price inelastic demand has a price elasticity of less than 1 and the percentage change in
            quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. This indicates that the quantity
            demand is not that sensitive or responsive to the price.
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            To see what the relationship is between a price inelastic demand and total spending, we will use
            the example of Thabo’s smoking habits.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: -34px;">
            Thabo’s weekly spending before the increase in price is P x Q = R30 x 10 = R300.
        </p>
        <p class="">
            This information is entered in the first row of the following table:
        </p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td></td>
                <td><strong>P</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Q<sub>d</sub></strong></td>
                <td><strong>Total spending per week (TS)</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Weekly spending at R30 per
                    packet
                </td>
                <td>R30</td>
                <td>10</td>
                <td>R300</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Weekly spending at R33 per
                    packet
                </td>
                <td>R33</td>
                <td>9.5</td>
                <td>R313,50</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            A 10% increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes increases the price to R33.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given a price elasticity of 0,5, it means that a 10% rise in the price will decrease the quantity
            demanded by 5%. For every 1% increase in price, the quantity demanded decreases by 0,5%. A
            10% increase in price therefore implies that the quantity demanded decreases by 10% x 0,5 =
            5%.
        </p>
        <p>
            His decrease in quantity demanded is therefore 5% x 10 packets = 0,5 packets. Thabo now
            smokes 10 – 0,5 = 9,5 packets of cigarettes per week, and his total weekly spending on
            cigarettes is R33 x 9,5 = R313,50. This information is entered in the table above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking at the information in the table, we can therefore conclude that as the price of
            cigarettes increases by 10%, Thabo’s total spending on cigarettes will increase from R300 to
            R313,50.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we can conclude from this is that if demand is relatively price inelastic, an increase in price
            will cause an increase in total spending of the good or service. The reason for this is that the
            percentage increase in price is greater than the percentage decrease in quantity demanded.

        </div>
        <h3>Using diagrams to illustrate total spending and price inelastic demand</h3>
        <p>
            We will use the same example of Thabo’s smoking habits to illustrate, with the aid of diagrams,
            what happens to total spending if the price of a good or service with an inelastic demand
            changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are given the following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thabo smokes 10 packets of cigarettes a week.</li>
            <li>The price of a packet of cigarettes is R30.</li>
            <li>His price elasticity is estimated at 0,5.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Next, we show graphically what happens to Thabo’s total spending if the price of cigarettes
            increases by 10%. The calculations we use are the same as those in our previous example, and
            are summarised in the following table:

                <td>9.5</td>
                <td>R313,50</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p class="activity-intro">
            Follow the steps below to see how this process appear graphically
        </p>


        <div class="activity-asset" style="margin-bottom:-36px;">
            <iframe src="2391.html" frameborder="0" id="asset2391" height="980"></iframe> 
        </div>
        <p>
            In the above explanation, we compared Thabo’s total spending before and after the increase
            in price, and then reached the conclusion that if demand is inelastic, an increase in price
            increases total spending.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Gains and losses
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another way of looking at it is to compare what he gains and what he loses when the price
            increases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thabo smokes 10 packets of cigarettes a week.</li>
            <li>The price of a packet of cigarettes is R30.</li>
            <li>His price elasticity is estimated at 0,5.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The argument is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the price increases from R30 to R33 he smokes half a packet (0,5) less.</li>
            <li>
                At a price of R30, by smoking half a packet less (0,5), he saves R15. This is indicated
                by <span style="color: #09436b">the blue rectangle</span> in the following diagram.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="row" style="text-align:center;margin:0;">
            <div class="col s12">
                <img src="../assets/113.svg" class="centered-graph">
            </div>
        </div>
        <ul style="margin-top:0;">
            <li>
                However, he now pays R33 for a packet – that is R3 more per packet. His increase in
                spending is therefore 9,5 x R3 = R28,50. This is indicated by <span style="color: #e7682a;">the orange rectangle</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
                His total spending thus increases by R28,50 – R15 = R13,50 (difference between the
                blue and orange rectangles).
            </li>
            <li>
                The orange rectangle is greater than the blue rectangle, showing that what he saves
                by smoking less is outweighed by the higher price he pays for the packets he does
                smoke.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once again we can reach the conclusion that if demand is inelastic, then an increase in the
            price will lead to an increase in total spending by households.
        </p>
        <h3>Decrease in price</h3>
        <p>What happens if the price of cigarettes decreases by 10%?</p>
        <p class="self-assessment-intro">
            Do the following activity by following the same steps as above 
            to see whether a decrease in the price of cigarettes increases or decreases
            his total spending.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Returning to our original questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Does an increase in the price cause households to increase or decrease their total
                spending on the good or service?
            </li>
            <li>
                Does a decrease in the price cause households to increase or decrease their total
                spending on the good or service?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            What we can say now is that if the price elasticity of a good or service is inelastic (less than 1), an
            increase in price will increase total spending, while a decrease in price will decrease total
            spending.
