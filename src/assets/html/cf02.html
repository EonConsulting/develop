        <h2>Three major flows</h2>
        <p>Our first task is to build a simple model that represents the following three main flows in the economy:  </p>
 <ul>
      <li>The <em>production flow</em>  comprises the production of goods and services by firms. It is here that the question of how to produce is answered. </li>
      <li>The <em>income flow </em> involves the flow of income to households which they earn from making the factors of production available for the production of goods
 and services by firms. Based on this income, the question of for whom to produce is answered. </li>
      <li>The <em>spending or expenditure flow </em> entails the spending by households on goods and services produced by the firms.
  It is during this flow that the question of what to produce is answered. </li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        



<p>The flows are not independent, but interdependent and closely linked. This interdependence between production, 
income and spending can be represented by the following circular flow diagram: <p>

        <p>A change in the flow of production will bring about a change in the flow of income which, 
in turn, will change the flow expenditure, which again will change the flow of production.  In the same way, 
an increase in spending will bring about an increase in production which, in turn, causes an increase in income.  
Similarly, an increase in income will bring about an increase in spending and then production. A major part of the study of
 macroeconomics is about how changes can be brought about in these flows.</p>
