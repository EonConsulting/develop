<h3 class="Heading2">Compare data sets</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Another reason for studying the dispersion in a set of data is to compare the spread in two or more sets of data.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">When comparing the spread of two separate data sets, named <span class="PalAa">A</span> and <span class="PalAb">B</span>, that have approximately the same mean, data set <span class="PalAa">A</span> has a <span class="PalAa">smaller standard deviation</span>. &nbsp;It has a <span class="PalAa">narrower spread</span> of measurements around the mean and therefore usually has comparatively <span class="PalAa">fewer high or low</span> data values. &nbsp;Data set <span class="PalAb">B</span> has a <span class="PalAb">larger standard deviation</span>. &nbsp;It has a <span class="PalAb">wider spread</span> of measurements around the mean and therefore usually has <span class="PalAb">more high and low</span> data values.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">An item selected at random from data set <span class="PalAa">A</span> whose <span class="PalAa">standard deviation</span> is <span class="PalAa">low</span> has a better chance of being <span class="PalAa">close to the mean</span> than an item from data set <span class="PalAb">B</span> whose <span class="PalAb">standard deviation</span> is <span class="PalAb">higher</span>.</span></p>
