<h3 class="Heading2">Recap</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Consider an obligation of <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span>&nbsp;which&nbsp;falls due in three years. &nbsp;Interest is credited quarterly at an interest rate of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(12\Ndp5\%\)</span> per annum.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Moving backwards</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Suppose you want to repay the <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> at the end of month six (two quarters from now).</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">If you move <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> backwards from quarter twelve to quarter two, you will pay less than <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span>. &nbsp;You will save on interest because you pay back the debt earlier than originally planned.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">The amount of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc{\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00}\)</span> at quarter twelve is the <span class="PalBc">future value</span> <span class="math-tex">\(\PalBc S\)</span>. &nbsp;You want to determine the amount at quarter two which is the <span class="PalAa">present value</span> <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAa P\)</span>.<br />
The value of <span class="math-tex">\(\PalAb n\)</span> is <span class="PalAb">ten</span>&nbsp;because the <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> is moved backwards by ten quarters.</span></p>

<h3 class="Heading3">Moving forwards</h3>

<p><span class="BodyText">Suppose you do not have money to repay the <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> after three years and want to repay it after four years.</span></p>

<p><span class="BodyText">If you move <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> forwards, from quarter 12 to quarter 16, you will pay more than <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span>. &nbsp;You will pay interest on the <span class="math-tex">\(\Cur50\Tsp000\Cdp00\)</span> because you pay back the debt later than originally planned.</span></p>
