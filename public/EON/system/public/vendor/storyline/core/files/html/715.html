        <h2>The price of other goods</h2>
        <p>Under the price of other goods we can distinguish between substitutes in
            production (alternative goods) and between complements in production
            (joint goods).</p>

        <h3>Substitutes in production</h3>
        <p>Substitutes in production refer to the fact that it is possible to
            produce different goods with the same resources. When producers decide what to produce, they always consider the prices of
            alternative outputs that they can produce with the same resources.</p>
        <p>
            Farmers producing maize will, for instance, take the price of soya beans
            into account when they decide how much land to allocate to the production
            of maize.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>An increase in the price of soya beans relative to that of maize will
            reduce the supply of maize. Because it is more profitable for farmers to
            produce soya beans, they will shift more of their resources to producing
            soya beans.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
            Using many of the same resources, fried chicken producers can make and
            supply a range of products (e.g. chicken burgers or chicken wraps). They
            need to figure out which of these products they should supply in order to
            make the highest profit.</p>

            <p style="margin-top:0px;">
            They also need to take into account that if the price of an alternative
            product (substitute in production) such a chicken burgers increases, it
            might be profitable for them to switch to supplying chicken burgers
            instead of continuing with their present line of business, namely
            supplying fried chicken pieces. This switch will cause a decline in the
            supply of fried chicken. The supply curve for the current product will
            therefore shift to the left, thus showing that supply has decreased. This
            is illustrated in the following diagram:

        <h3>Complements in production</h3>
        <p>Some products are produced jointly (e.g. sugar and molasses, wheat and
            bran, lead and zinc, beef and leather, cotton and cotton seed).&nbsp;
            <i>Complements-in-production</i> are two or more goods that are jointly <i>produced</i>
            using a given resource.</p>
        <p>An increase in the supply of the major product (beef) results in an
            increase in the supply of the by-product (leather), and the supply curve
            for the by-product shifts to the right.&nbsp;At every price, a greater
            quantity is supplied than before the increase in the supply of the major
            product.
