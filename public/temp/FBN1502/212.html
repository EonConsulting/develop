<h3 class="Heading2">Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">An <span class="Emphasis_1">equation</span> is a statement in which two algebraic expressions are equal.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">A <span class="Emphasis_1">linear equation</span> is a simple equation of degree one, that is, the highest exponent of the unknown variable is one.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Solving a linear equation in one variable means finding the <span class="Emphasis_1">value of the variable</span>. &nbsp;This involves performing the same operations to both sides of an equation to maintain equality while working to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">Given any equation, if you multiply, divide, add&nbsp;or subtract the same number on both sides, the <span class="Emphasis_1">equality</span> of the&nbsp;new equation will hold. &nbsp;You can also raise both sides to the same power and keep equality.</span><br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><span class="Bullet_List_2">To get the variable you are solving&nbsp;alone on one side and everything else on the other side, you use <span class="Emphasis_1">inverse</span> operations.</span></li>
</ul>
